Felix Barry Moore (born September 26, 1966) is an American politician who is the U.S. representative for Alabama's 1st congressional district since 2025. It includes the entirety of Washington, Mobile, Baldwin and Monroe counties, as well as most of Escambia County. The largest city in the district is Mobile. He represented the 91st district in the Alabama House of Representatives from 2010 to 2018.
Moore first ran for the U.S. Congress to represent Alabama's 2nd congressional district in 2018, challenging incumbent representative Martha Roby. He finished third in the Republican primary. After Roby's retirement in 2020, Moore launched a campaign for the open seat. He won the primary and defeated Democrat Phyllis Harvey-Hall in the general election. In 2024, following redistricting as a result of Allen v. Milligan, Moore was placed into Alabama's 1st congressional district and ran against fellow incumbent representative Jerry Carl in the Republican primary. Moore narrowly won nomination in the new district, unseating Carl.


== Early life and education ==
Moore was born in Coffee County, Alabama, on September 26, 1966. He grew up on a farm in Coffee County, and attended Enterprise State Community College. He later attended Auburn University, where he received a Bachelor of Science degree in agricultural science in 1992. While attending Auburn, Moore enlisted in the Alabama National Guard.


== Early career ==
In 1998, Moore founded Barry Moore Industries, a waste hauling company.


=== Alabama House of Representatives ===
Moore entered politics in 2010 at the urging of then-chair of the Alabama Republican Party Mike Hubbard. Moore was elected to the Alabama House of Representatives in 2010, defeating Democratic incumbent Terry Spicer.
In April 2014, Moore was arrested for felony perjury and lying to authorities during a grand jury investigation into Hubbard. Moore was acquitted of all charges.


== United States House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 2018 ====

In 2018, Moore challenged incumbent U.S. Representative Martha Roby in the Republican primary for AL-02, placing third behind Roby and former U.S. Representative Bobby Bright.


==== 2020 ====

Moore again sought the nomination in 2020. The seat was open after Roby opted not to run for a sixth term. Moore placed second in the seven-way Republican primary, the real contest in the heavily Republican district, trailing Dothan businessman Jeff Coleman. He then defeated Coleman in the runoff, which had been delayed almost three months due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In that time, Coleman's campaign faltered, and Moore eventually won. He then defeated Democratic nominee Phyllis Harvey-Hall in the general election with 65.2% of the vote.


==== 2022 ====

Moore ran for reelection in 2022. In the Republican primary, Moore initially faced a challenge from Jeff Coleman, who announced another bid for the second congressional district. However, a federal panel ruled against Coleman's candidacy, as he qualified to run after the first deadline had passed, and the decision implementing a second deadline was reversed. This left Moore unopposed in the Republican primary. In the general election, Moore faced Democratic nominee Phyllis Harvey-Hall in a rematch; he was reelected to a second term with 69% of the vote.


==== 2024 ====

In 2024, redistricting as a result of Allen v. Milligan placed Moore into Alabama's 1st congressional district, which was represented by Jerry Carl, setting up a primary in which Moore and Carl were both incumbents pitted against each other in the 1st district. On October 30, 2023, Moore confirmed to 1819 News that he would run in the first congressional district, challenging Carl in the Republican primary.
In the Republican primary on March 5, 2024, Moore narrowly won the Republican nomination against Carl, despite running in a district that was geographically more Carl's district than Moore's. The new 1st retained 60% of Carl’s constituents.
In October 2024, The Washington Post reported that the Chinese government was using its Spamouflage influence operation to target Moore with accusations that he won his primary because of "the bloody Jewish consortium," as well as calling him a "Jewish dog", among other antisemitic tropes. Moore has been critical of the Chinese Communist Party, and has directed support for Taiwanese independence. Moore is not Jewish.


=== Tenure ===
On January 6, 2021, Moore objected to the certification of the 2020 U.S. presidential election results in Congress. On January 7, he was one of 147 Republican lawmakers who voted to overturn results in the election, immediately after the storming of the U.S. Capitol. On January 10, Moore drew criticism for two posts on his personal Twitter account, one of which echoed the false claim of "stealing an election on November 3rd." Moore also posted about the killing of Ashli Babbitt, saying that a black officer shooting a white female veteran "doesn't fit the narrative." Twitter temporarily suspended his account; in response, Moore deactivated the account, alleging censorship of conservative voices. His official government Twitter account was unaffected.
In February 2021, Moore voted against the American Rescue Plan, calling it a "blue state bailout". The same month, he co-signed Bob Good's Right To Earn A Living Act, which would make state and local governments that implement pandemic-related stay-at-home orders ineligible for funding through the Coronavirus Relief Fund.
In March 2021, during a House vote on a measure condemning the Myanmar coup d'état that overwhelmingly passed, Moore was one of 14 House Republicans to vote against it.
In June 2021, Moore was one of 21 House Republicans to vote against a resolution to give the Congressional Gold Medal to police officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on January 6.
In June 2021, Moore was one of 49 House Republicans to vote to repeal the AUMF against Iraq.
In July 2021, Moore voted against the bipartisan ALLIES Act, which would increase by 8,000 the number of special immigrant visas for allies of the U.S. military during its invasion of Afghanistan, while also reducing some application requirements that caused long application backlogs; the bill passed in the House 407–16. Later in August 2021, after the Taliban gained control of Afghanistan, Moore called the American withdrawal from Afghanistan "a painful betrayal of our Afghan allies".
As of January 2022, Moore had voted in line with Joe Biden's stated position 6% of the time.
In February 2023, Moore introduced a bill, co-sponsored by Andrew Clyde, Lauren Boebert, and George Santos, to designate the "AR-15-style rifle" the National Gun of the United States.

Michael Dennis Rogers (born July 16, 1958) is an American lawyer and politician serving as the U.S. representative for Alabama's 3rd congressional district since 2003. He is a member of the Republican Party. Rogers is the Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee where he served as the Ranking Member from 2021 to 2023 and as the Ranking Member of the House Homeland Security Committee from 2019 to 2021.


== Early life and education ==
A sixth-generation resident of Calhoun County in East Alabama, Rogers graduated from Saks High School and earned both his undergraduate degree in political science and Master's of Public Administration at Jacksonville State University. He graduated from  Birmingham School of Law.


== Early political career ==
At age 28, Rogers became the youngest person to join the Calhoun County Commission. In 1994, Rogers won a seat in the Alabama House of Representatives, and became minority leader in his second term.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===
In 2002, U.S. Representative Bob Riley was elected governor of Alabama, leaving Alabama's 3rd congressional district seat open. Rogers won the Republican nomination. In the general election, he faced Democratic veteran Joe Turnham, Jr., who had served three years as state party chairman and had run against Riley for Congress in 1998. The Democratic and Republican national parties targeted the district, with Speaker Dennis Hastert promising Rogers a seat on the Armed Services Committee should he win. Rogers outspent Turnham, raising and spending $1,656,290 to Turnham's $1,015,132, and held an even greater margin in independent expenditures. Rogers defeated Turnham, 50% to 48%. In this election, he was a rare Republican endorsee of The Anniston Star.


==== Campaign contributions from ARMPAC ====
Rogers received campaign contributions from former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay's ARMPAC. DeLay was convicted of felony money laundering of campaign finances and conspiracy to launder money. As of August 2016, Rogers has not offered to return any of the $30,000 he received. Rogers said that DeLay is innocent until proven guilty, and that he would not return the money "while the judicial process runs its course".


=== Tenure ===


==== 112th Congress (2011–2013) ====
In December 2011, Rogers voted in support of H.R. 10, the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act, which would have required Congressional approval for any "major regulations" issued by the executive branch but, unlike the 1996 Congressional Review Act, would not require the president's signature or override of a probable presidential veto.


==== 115th Congress (2017–2019) ====
In 2017, Rogers worked with Representative Jim Cooper on a proposal to establish a Space Corps under the Department of the Air Force. The proposal passed the House and failed in the Senate. A bill with very similar language was signed into law two years later to create the United States Space Force. Rogers has been a major proponent of the Space Development Agency and taking an aggressive approach to space militarization.
In August 2017, Rogers held a town hall event in Oxford, Alabama, focused on efforts to repeal to the Affordable Care Act. During the town hall, a constituent raised questions about campaign donations to Rogers and his wife Beth, a Calhoun County District Court judge. The constituent specifically asked about monetary contributions to the Rogerses from Mike Hubbard, who was convicted of ethics violations in 2016. Rogers said that Hubbard was a family friend and appeared to threaten the constituent, saying, "you keep my wife out of this and be a man or we'll take it outside". The constituent said he filed a complaint with the Oxford police department over Rogers's comments.


==== 117th Congress (2021–2023) ====
Rogers was at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, when it was attacked. The next day, he tweeted, "there is no place for political violence in America" and called for law and order. Even after the attack, Rogers supported efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results, voting to oppose the certification. He voted against impeaching Donald Trump a second time in the wake of the attack. His rationale for his decision was that the impeachment was a partisan action by Nancy Pelosi that would "further divide our nation".
Rogers voted against the American Rescue Plan in February 2021. His rationale for opposing the bill was that it was full of "extreme socialist initiatives" and too expensive, and that it was too soon for another bill after the December 2020 Consolidated Appropriations Act. He also said the bill did not support schools reopening and that it funded abortions.
As of October 2021, Rogers had voted in line with Joe Biden's stated position 10.3% of the time.


==== 118th Congress (2023–2025) ====
During the January 2023 Speaker of the United States House of Representatives election, Rogers suggested that committee assignments be stripped from representatives who did not vote for Kevin McCarthy. He told Politico that his comments were more than a threat, saying "I promised it". Rogers called the representatives voting against McCarthy "legislative terrorists who have no problem killing the hostage".

During the 14th ballot for Speaker, Rogers lunged at Representative Matt Gaetz after Gaetz spoke with McCarthy. Representative Richard Hudson then had to physically restrain Rogers. The Associated Press reported that Rogers "charged" at Gaetz before Hudson pulled Rogers back by the shoulder, then the face. According to The New York Times, Gaetz was seeking a subcommittee chairmanship in the House Armed Services Committee, of which Rogers was in line to become chair. Multiple representatives criticized Rogers after the confrontation, including Marjorie Taylor Greene, who said it was "out of line" and expected consequences for Rogers, and Tim Burchett, who compared Rogers's actions to being under the influence of alcohol on the House floor, saying "people shouldn't be drinking, especially when you're a redneck, on the House floor". Burchett later retracted his comments about Rogers, saying that they were made out of frustration and that "we're all friends".
During an appearance on Fox News on January 8, 2023, Gaetz said that he had forgiven Rogers for the outburst and that he was looking forward to working with Rogers on the House Armed Services Committee. Gaetz also said he did not think Rogers should be punished for an "animated moment". Later that day, Rogers tweeted a message of reconciliation in response to Gaetz, saying that he regretted losing his temper on the House floor and that he would be happy to continue his working relationship with Gaetz.
On January 9, 2023, multiple media outlets reported that Rogers was planning to step down from the House Steering Committee in the wake of the controversy. Rogers confirmed to Politico that he was considering the decision, but said it had not yet been finalized; 1819 News reported that Rogers "may change his mind". Less than 12 hours later, Rogers said he would not resign from the committee, saying that both Republican and Democratic leaders had urged him not to. Politico called Rogers's reversal an example of the "dishevelment" in the House following McCarthy's election to the speakership.
Following the first indictment of Donald Trump in March 2023, Rogers called the proceedings a "sham" and called for the resignation of district attorney Alvin Bragg.
In April 2023, as chair of the U.S. House Armed Services Committee, Rogers delivered statements urging advancement of the Next Generation Interceptor (NGI) missile program in support of Taiwan against the Chinese Communist Party. 1819 News published a report showing that Lockheed Martin, which is competing for the contract to build the NGI missiles, is Rogers's largest campaign contributor. Rogers has a history of advocating for arms development under Lockheed Martin, including similar comments from January 2023 for Lockheed artillery weapons to be supplied to Ukraine. He never served in the military.
During the October 2023 Speaker of the United States House of Representatives election, after the removal of Kevin McCarthy as speaker, Rogers called those who had supported McCarthy's ouster "traitors" and accused them of "paralyzing" the House of Representatives. Rogers initially refused to support Jim Jordan for Speaker of the House, even after he had been nominated by Republicans for the speakership. Rogers told reporters that he was willing to compromise with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries to nominate a bipartisan moderate speaker instead of Jordan. Rogers' comments were met with scrutiny by conservative colleagues, including Senator Mike Lee from Utah and former U.S. representative Mo Brooks from Alabama. Additionally, members of the Alabama Republican Party state executive committee, including members from the third district, threatened to file a challenge against Rogers' ballot access in the 2024 election. On October 16, 2023, Rogers issued a statement endorsing Jordan for Speaker of the House, reversing his position and establishing his support for Jordan. In the statement, Rogers said that he had "always been a team player" and would support the Republican conference's decision on the speakership.
Upon Trump's 2024 re-election to a non-consecutive term as president, Rogers was reportedly contacted by Trump's transition team as a potential nominee for Secretary of Defense.

Robert Brown Aderholt ( AD-ər-hohlt; born July 22, 1965) is an American politician and attorney serving as the U.S. representative for Alabama's 4th congressional district since 1997. He is a member of the Republican Party. The district includes most of Tuscaloosa County north of the Black Warrior River, as well as Birmingham's far northern suburbs in Walker County and the southern suburbs of Huntsville and Decatur.
A social conservative, Aderholt was a member of the Tea Party Caucus. He became the dean of Alabama's congressional delegation following Senator Richard Shelby's retirement at the end of the 117th Congress. According to the Cook Partisan Voting Index, Aderholt represents the most Republican district in the country, with an index rating of R+33.


== Early life and education ==
Aderholt was born in Haleyville, Alabama, to Mary Frances Brown and Bobby Ray Aderholt. Aderholt's father, a part-time minister for a small group of Congregational churches in northwest Alabama, was a circuit judge for more than 30 years. He attended the University of North Alabama and then Birmingham-Southern College, from which he graduated with a degree in history and political science. During college, Aderholt was a member of Kappa Alpha Order. Aderholt received his J.D. from the Samford University Cumberland School of Law and practiced law after graduation.


== Career ==
In 1992, Aderholt was appointed Haleyville municipal judge. The same year, he was a delegate to the Republican National Convention. In 1995, he became the top aide to Governor Fob James. He won the 1996 Republican primary in the race to succeed 15-term Democratic incumbent Tom Bevill.
As the Republican nominee, Aderholt faced a considerable challenge against State Senator Bob Wilson Jr., who called himself a Democrat "in the Tom Bevill tradition". This was a seriously contested race, receiving considerable national coverage and significant support from the Republican Party. Newt Gingrich personally visited the district during the campaign. Aderholt won, 50%–48%, becoming only the second Republican to represent the district since Reconstruction. Two years later, he was reelected over Tom Bevil, Jr., his predecessor's son. The first Republican to win the seat had been Jim Martin, who was swept into office in what was then the 7th District during the 1964 wave that delivered the state's electoral votes to Barry Goldwater. After his first win, Aderholt has never faced another contest nearly that close, and has been reelected nine times. He ran unopposed in 2004, 2010, 2014, and 2016. His increasing margins reflected the growing Republican trend in this part of Alabama.
Aderholt is associated with the Fellowship Foundation, which paid for his trip to Romania in 2017 to promote "traditional family values". Over the course of 16 years, Aderholt traveled to 18 countries on the Fellowship's behalf.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Tenure ===
Aderholt is one of 147 Republican lawmakers who voted to overturn results in the 2020 presidential election. He was at the Capitol to certify the election results when it was attacked. During the attack, he tweeted a prayer to God to "guide & protect this nation." In a video message, he later said that some of the attackers "crossed the line". Even after the attack, he supported overturning the election. Aderholt later opposed impeaching Trump for the second time.
In February 2021, Aderholt voted against the American Rescue Plan, claiming that his opposition was because half the bill's funding went to "unrelated liberal policies" and that the bill "has nothing to do with COVID-19 relief".
As of October 2021, Aderholt had voted in line with Joe Biden's stated position 7.5% of the time.
In January 2023, Aderholt announced that he had secured $13.8 million in funding for 14 infrastructure projects in his district, including broadband expansion, roadways and access to medical care. Although announced during the 118th Congress, the funds were from the previous House session.
In February 2023, CoinDesk reported that Aderholt is one of three members of Alabama's congressional delegation who received money from FTX, the defunct cryptocurrency exchange, alongside Katie Britt and Gary Palmer. His office did not respond to a CoinDesk inquiry about what had been done with the funds.
Aderholt voted to provide Israel with support following the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.

== Political positions ==

=== Abortion ===

During the March for Life in Washington on January 22, 2010, Aderholt said, "The issue of abortion and the sanctity of life is something that I feel strongly about and I encourage my colleagues to look for ways to curb and stop abortions in the United States, while compassionately educating on this important issue." Aderholt supported the 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade and called it a "watershed moment for life".


=== Budget and economy ===
Aderholt opposes reducing the defense budget to close the American deficit, and in May 2012 said "cuts to defense budgets – the federal government's primary Constitutional responsibility – shouldn't be the relief valve for uncontrolled domestic program spending".
During the 2023 United States debt-ceiling crisis, Aderholt voted for the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023. Aderholt called the debt-ceiling deal between Kevin McCarthy and President Joe Biden "a step in the right direction", though he also said it was "not perfect".

Aderholt opposes same-sex marriage. Aderholt condemned the Supreme Court decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, which held that same-sex marriage bans violated the US constitution. He has received high ratings from the Family Research Council, the Traditional Values Coalition, and the American Family Association. In 2013, the Human Rights Campaign gave him a score of 0 on its Congressional Scorecard.


=== Environment ===
During the 111th Congress, Aderholt voted for Steve Scalise's amendment to "require that Congress be allowed to vote on any executive regulation that would impose any tax, price, or levy upon carbon emissions... effectively prevents the executive branch from levying any form of carbon tax without Congressional approval. Since a carbon tax would be tremendously destructive to the economy as a whole, this measure would hopefully make such a tax unlikely to pass." Aderholt opposed regulations on greenhouse gas emissions, and in December 2008 helped write a letter to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that read, "I am opposed to any attempt to impose greenhouse gas regulations under the Clean Air Act on the agricultural industry."


=== Gun policy ===
Aderholt supports gun rights. He has been repeatedly endorsed by the NRA Political Victory Fund, and received $2,000 in 2010.
In the wake of the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, Aderholt called it a terrorist attack and said, "we do not have the luxury of debating the political correctness of 'radical Islam'", adding that there was a need to "hunt down those who would do us harm". He opposed the media and President Obama using the shooting to "push any type of political agenda relating to gun control" and called on the White House and Congress to "protect the homeland".


=== Health care ===
In 2019, Aderholt introduced a bill to raise the minimum age to purchase tobacco to 21.


=== Regulatory reform ===
In December 2011, Aderholt voted in support of H.R. 10, the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act, which would have required congressional approval for any "major regulations" issued by the executive branch but, unlike the 1996 Congressional Review Act, would not require the president's signature or override of a probable presidential veto.


=== Tax policy ===
Aderholt is a signer of Americans for Tax Reform's Taxpayer Protection Pledge. He voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, saying it would "give back more money to Alabama taxpayers" and "does the right thing". He cited the raising of the child tax credit, changes to the state and local tax deductions, and said, "more than 80% the people in the 4th District of Alabama will receive a tax cut." Aderholt also said that more businesses will stay in the U.S. due to a lower corporate tax rate and therefore the act is a "jobs bill".


=== Texas v. Pennsylvania ===
In December 2020, Aderholt was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated incumbent Donald Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.


=== Defense ===
In September 2021, Aderholt was among 75 House Republicans to vote against the National Defense Authorization Act of 2022, which contains a provision that would require women to be drafted.

Gary James Palmer (born May 14, 1954) is an American politician serving as the U.S. representative for Alabama's 6th congressional district since 2015. His district includes the wealthier parts of Birmingham, as well as most of its suburbs. Before becoming an elected official, Palmer co-founded and served as the longtime president of the Alabama Policy Institute, a conservative think tank.
A member of the House Freedom Caucus, Palmer has chaired the Republican Policy Committee since 2019, making him the 5th highest-ranking Republican in the House of Representatives.


== Early life, education, and career ==
Palmer was born in Hackleburg, Alabama. His family lived on a 40-acre farm, where Palmer helped maintain the family garden and animals.
Palmer has a bachelor's degree in operations management from the University of Alabama. He was the first member of his family to earn a college degree. He was a walk-on wide receiver for the Crimson Tide and played under Bear Bryant. In 1989, Palmer co-founded the Alabama Family Alliance, which later became the Alabama Policy Institute. He served as its president for 25 years, stepping down in 2014 to run for Congress. Palmer helped found the State Policy Network, a nonprofit umbrella organization for conservative and libertarian think tanks that focus on state-level policy, and served as its president.

=== Elections ===


==== 2014 ====

Palmer declared his candidacy for the 6th district following the retirement announcement of 11-term incumbent Spencer Bachus. In a crowded seven-way Republican primary—the real contest in this heavily Republican district—Palmer finished second behind state representative Paul DeMarco. In the ensuing runoff election, Palmer picked up the support of the Club for Growth. Despite outspending Palmer, DeMarco lost momentum after a botched debate with Palmer and never recovered. By election day, polls suggested Palmer would win the nomination by 30 points. Palmer won the runoff, 64% to 36%. In the general election, he defeated Democratic nominee Mark Lester, a history professor at Birmingham-Southern College, 76% to 24%, but he had effectively clinched a seat in Congress with his primary victory. With a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+28, the 6th was tied with the neighboring 4th as Alabama's most Republican district.
Palmer has been reelected three times with only nominal opposition, running unopposed in 2020. He has only dropped below 70% once. In 2018, Democrat Danner Kline held him to 69.2%. Kline received 30.8% of the vote, the best showing for a Democrat in almost a quarter-century. It is the only time since the GOP began its current run in the seat in 1993 that a Democrat has managed 30% of the vote.


==== 2022 ====

Palmer ran for reelection to the House in the general election on November 8, 2022. Unchallenged in the Republican primary and with no Democratic candidates qualified to run in this district, Palmer was initially left unopposed. However, the Libertarian Party qualified for ballot access in May 2022, giving Palmer a general-election opponent, Amazon supervisor Andria Chieffo. Palmer defeated Chieffo in the general election with 83.7% of the vote to Chieffo's 15.1%.


=== Tenure ===

Palmer took office on January 3, 2015, along with the other freshmen members of the 114th Congress.
Palmer voted against the American Rescue Plan, an economic recovery and COVID-19 relief bill, in February 2021. His rationale for opposing the bill was that it was "not about COVID relief, but about the Democrat agenda", and a "repeat of the failed stimulus bill passed in 2009 under President Obama and then Vice President Biden."
In November 2021, Palmer touted funding for the Birmingham Northern Beltline that he added to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. But he voted against the final bill and did not mention his vote in a Twitter post celebrating the funding. Democratic figures including Alabama Democratic Party chair Christopher J. England, U.S. Senator Brian Schatz, and U.S. Representative Eric Swalwell criticized Palmer's comments as hypocritical. A spokesperson for Palmer defended the Twitter post, saying, "it should not be surprising that he supports a provision that he authored".
As of October 2021, Palmer had voted in line with President Joe Biden's stated position 7.5% of the time.
Bloomberg Government has called Palmer a "quiet lawmaker" who nonetheless fulfills an important role in shaping the House Republican agenda as chair of the Republican Policy Committee. In response to Democratic critiques that Republicans lack a policy agenda, Palmer has said he takes a more "proactive" strategy to crafting policy, rather than a "combative" style. As chair of the committee, Palmer compiled a 200-page "Guide to the Issues" for Republican representatives and frequently distributes information on policy to fellow legislators.
In February 2023, CoinDesk reported that Palmer was one of three members of Alabama's congressional delegation who received money from FTX, the defunct cryptocurrency exchange, alongside Robert Aderholt and Katie Britt. Palmer's office did not respond to a CoinDesk inquiry about what had been done with the funds.
In the October 2023 Speaker of the United States House of Representatives election, Palmer was briefly a candidate for Speaker of the House in the third nomination cycle. The New York Times described him as a candidate who could present himself as a unifying force between the battling factions of the Republican Party. He dropped out of the race for Speaker prior to an internal caucus forum.


=== Committee assignments ===
For the 118th Congress:

Committee on Energy and Commerce
Subcommittee on Energy, Climate, and Grid Security
Subcommittee on Environment, Manufacturing, and Critical Minerals
Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations
Committee on Oversight and Accountability
Subcommittee on Government Operations and the Federal Workforce


=== Caucus memberships ===
Freedom Caucus
Republican Study Committee


== Political positions ==
As of 2020, Palmer has a 92% rating for supporting conservative causes, according to Heritage Action. The American Conservative Union's center for legislative accountability gave him a 97% lifetime conservative rating and the progressive PAC Americans for Democratic Action gave him a 0% liberal quotient in 2019.


=== Abortion ===
Palmer opposes legal abortion. Palmer supported the 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade.


=== Economy ===
Palmer voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. He said the bill would "put more money in the pockets of the American people" and "launch economic growth." He blamed the Obama administration and a "burdensome tax code that was designed for a 1986 economy" for an "anemic" economy.
Palmer was among the 71 Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 in the House. He was also one of three members of Alabama's House delegation to vote against the bill, the others being Barry Moore and Dale Strong.


=== LGBTQ rights ===
Palmer has stated that allowing transgender people to use the bathroom of their choice is something "no reasonable person" would allow and said that "the safety implications for sexual predation have been well documented." He opposes same-sex marriage, saying, "No one can change the fundamental nature of what marriage is: the union of a man and a woman and the formation of a family which is the foundation of every civilization."


=== COVID-19 ===
During the COVID-19 crisis, Palmer opposed proxy voting while Congress was unable to work onsite at the Capitol due to shelter-in-place orders.


=== Drugs ===
Palmer voted to support medical marijuana research but opposes legalizing marijuana.


=== Gun law ===
Palmer supports gun rights. He opposes what he deems unconstitutional gun restrictions. He supports efforts that enable legal gun owners to carry their guns, including concealed carry, over state lines.


=== Health care ===
Palmer opposes the Affordable Care Act, calling it "a nightmare" and "job-killing." He supports efforts to repeal it.


=== Homeland security ===
Palmer is pro-nuclear weapons. He supports increasing funding for the Defense Department specifically around work in the Middle East.


=== Immigration ===
Palmer opposes illegal immigration to the United States, including allowing undocumented workers to work in the U.S. He supports efforts to deport undocumented immigrants.


=== Term limits ===
After his election in 2014, Palmer signed the U.S. Term Limits pledge, agreeing to sponsor legislation enacting term limits for U.S. representatives and senators. He also said he would serve no more than five terms in office. In September 2021, the U.S. Term Limits group accused Palmer of refusing to cosponsor a term limits amendment, alleging that he had broken the pledge. The group purchased billboards in Alabama's 6th congressional district attacking Palmer. Palmer's reelection campaign responded by calling the accusation "fake news", saying that the pledge only applied to the 114th United States Congress and that Palmer cosponsored the amendment for three consecutive terms. Palmer's five-term limit meant that the 2022 elections would be his last. But in March 2022, he said he made the pledge before becoming a part of Republican leadership in Congress and that he was also taking high turnover in Alabama's congressional delegation into consideration, indicating that he would likely run for reelection in 2024 to maintain senior leadership from Alabama, despite the commitment.
In March 2023, Palmer officially announced his 2024 reelection campaign, saying that he "prayed for God to give me clarity on" his decision to run for a sixth term. He disputed media reports (including an article by AL.com) that characterized his five-term limit as part of the U.S. Term Limits pledge, saying the pledge only applied to sponsoring legislation. But Palmer acknowledged that he did claim during his 2014 campaign that he would serve no more than five terms, and said he would "own that".


=== 2020 presidential election ===
Palmer was at the Capitol to certify the 2020 presidential election results on January 6, 2021, when the attack on the Capitol took place. During the attack, Palmer tweeted that it was a "sad day" and that "the scenes we witnessed today were unacceptable". After the attack, Palmer voted against certifying the election, objecting to Arizona's and Pennsylvania's electoral votes. On January 13, Palmer blamed Donald Trump for "sending" the attackers to the Capitol. He voted against impeaching Trump a second time, calling the second impeachment a Democratic "abuse of power" and a "sham process."
In December 2020, Palmer was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.

Nicholas Joseph Begich III ( BEH-ghitch; born October 21, 1977) is an American politician and businessman who has been serving as the U.S. representative for Alaska's at-large congressional district since 2025. A member of the Republican Party, he had previously ran for the seat in the 2022 special and regular elections before his election in 2024.


== Early life and family ==

Begich was born on October 21, 1977, in Anchorage, Alaska, to Nicholas Joseph Begich Jr., an author and business owner, and Starr Lyn Weed (née Baker). He is a member of the political Begich family who have been affiliated with the Democratic Party, although he is a Republican. He is the paternal grandson of Nick Begich Sr., who served as a U.S. Representative for Alaska from 1971 until his disappearance in a plane crash in 1972. Begich Sr. had three notable sons: Nick Begich Jr., Mark Begich, and Tom Begich. Mark Begich served as a U.S. Senator from Alaska; Tom Begich served as the Minority Leader of the Alaska Senate.
According to Begich, his mother's family was very Republican and his father is a Libertarian Party member. Begich said he has been a registered Republican since age 21.
Begich attended and graduated from a Florida high school, having moved to Florida with his maternal grandparents after his parents divorced. He received a Bachelor of Business Administration from Baylor University, Texas. Afterwards, he received a Master of Business Administration from Indiana University Bloomington.


== Business career ==
After graduating, he founded FarShore Partners, a software development company which is mostly based in India. In 2016, it had 160 employees internationally. Begich has been business partners with Rick Desai since 2009. He was later joined by his other business partner, JC Garrett, in managing both FarShore Partners and Dashfire. As of 2021, he served as the company's executive chairman.


== Political career ==
In 2016, he ran for Seat A in District 2 (Chugiak/Eagle River) of the Anchorage City Council against Republican incumbent Amy Demboski. Begich lost, receiving 42 percent of the vote to Demboski's 58 percent.
He has served as a board member of Alaska Policy Forum, a conservative think tank. He was the co-chair of the Alaska Republican Party's Finance Committee. He served as a co-chair on Don Young's 2020 re-election campaign for the U.S. House.


=== 2022 special election ===

In October 2021, he announced his campaign to run for the Alaska's at-large U.S. House seat against incumbent Republican Don Young, who held the seat since 1972. Young died in March 2022 which led to a special election scheduled for August 16, 2022. The election was a 3-way race of Begich, former Republican Alaska Governor Sarah Palin and Democratic former state Representative Mary Peltola.
The election was the first to use Alaska's new ranked-choice voting (RCV) method, approved by voters in 2020. The winners of the top-four blanket primary advanced to the ranked-choice runoff election, but only three candidates competed (as Al Gross withdrew and endorsed Peltola). Peltola was declared the winner on August 31 after all ballots were counted. Peltola's victory was widely seen as an upset in a traditionally Republican state.
The results were praised by many pundits and activists. By contrast, some scholars criticized the instant-runoff procedure for its pathological behavior, the result of a center squeeze. Although Peltola received a plurality of first choice votes and won in the final round, a majority of voters ranked her last or left her off their ballot entirely. Begich was eliminated in the first round, despite being preferred by a majority to each one of his opponents, with 53 percent of voters ranking him above Peltola. However, Palin spoiled the election by splitting the first-round vote, leading to Begich's elimination and costing Republicans the seat.


=== 2022 regular election ===

The regular 2022 Alaska's at-large U.S. House election was held on November 8. The four candidates were incumbent Peltola, Palin, Begich, and Libertarian Chris Bye. Under the rules of instant-runoff, Bye and Begich were eliminated in the first and second rounds, after they received the fewest votes. These votes were then transferred to either Peltola or Palin, depending on who the voter ranked higher on their ballot. Peltola won with 55 percent of the vote, increasing her margin from the special election.
Social choice theorists commenting on the race noted that unlike the previous special election, the general election involved few election pathologies. Peltola won the election as the majority-preferred (Condorcet) candidate, with ballots indicating support from a majority of voters.


=== 2024 regular election ===

The regular 2024 Alaska's at-large U.S. House election was held on November 5. The election coincided with the 2024 U.S. presidential election, as well as other elections to the U.S. House, elections to the United States Senate, and various other state and local elections.
The primary election was held on August 20, 2024, with candidates Mary Peltola, Nick Begich, and Republican Nancy Dahlstrom emerging as the main candidates. After placing third, Dahlstrom withdrew from the race to avoid another result like 2022 to ensure there was no center squeeze or  spoiler effect, resulting in a traditional two-party race with two clear frontrunners. The four candidates were Begich, Peltola, Alaskan Independence Party candidate John Wayne Howe, and Democrat Eric Hafner.
On November 20, it was announced that Begich defeated Peltola. In the first round, he achieved 48.42% of the vote against her 46.36%. After other candidates were eliminated, the final round resulted in Begich receiving 51.3% of the vote against Peltola's 48.7%, making him the winner.


== Personal life ==
He lives in Chugiak, Anchorage, Alaska. Begich and his wife, Dharna, have one son Nicholas IV. He is a Protestant.

David Sheridan Schweikert ( SHWY-kərt; born March 3, 1962) is an American politician and businessman serving as the U.S. representative from Arizona's 1st congressional district since 2023. The district covers northeastern Maricopa County.
He previously served as the U.S. representative for Arizona's 6th congressional district from 2013 to 2023. A member of the Republican Party, he first entered Congress in 2011, representing Arizona's 5th congressional district until redistricting. His district includes most of northern Phoenix as well as Scottsdale, Paradise Valley, and Cave Creek.
Schweikert served two terms in the Arizona State House of Representatives (1991–1994), chaired the state Board of Equalization (1995–2004), and was the elected Maricopa County treasurer (2004–2007). He ran for the U.S. House of Representatives twice (losing the primary to J. D. Hayworth in 1994 and the general election to incumbent Harry Mitchell in 2008) before being elected in 2010.


== Early life and education ==
Schweikert was born to an unwed teenage mother, Mary Lynn Sheridan, in Los Angeles, California. According to Schweikert, Sheridan had considered an abortion but chose instead to place him for adoption. He grew up in Scottsdale with his adoptive parents and two adopted siblings. He graduated from Saguaro High School in 1980, then earned a Bachelor of Science degree in finance and real estate in 1985 and an MBA from W.P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University.


== Early career ==


=== Arizona House of Representatives (1991–1995) ===
Schweikert was elected to the Arizona State House of Representatives for District 28 in 1990 and reelected in 1992. He represented Fountain Hills and part of Scottsdale. He was a committee chair as a freshman and majority whip in his second term.


=== Local politics (1995–2007) ===
Schweikert was appointed chair of the Arizona State Board of Equalization, a full-time job, and served from 1995 to 2003. As chair, he oversaw billions of dollars in valuations and tax protests from Arizona citizens and businesses. There was speculation in 1999 that Arizona governor Jane Dee Hull might appoint him to the Arizona Corporation Commission.
Schweikert was appointed Chief Deputy Treasurer of Maricopa County in 2004 and elected treasurer the same year. He resigned in 2007 to run for Congress again. Professionally, he worked in real estate.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 1994 ====
Schweikert ran in the September Republican primary in Arizona's 6th congressional district. It included NE Arizona, including parts of Metro Phoenix. J. D. Hayworth defeated him, 45%–22%. After that defeat, Schweikert took time to reconsider and left for a lengthy vacation, which included travel to Kolkata, the Philippines, Myanmar, and Serbia, among other places.


==== 2008 ====

Schweikert won a six-way Republican primary election on September 2 with 30% of the vote, compared to 27% for his nearest rival, Susan Bitter Smith.
Several organizations endorsed Schweikert in the election, including the primary: Club for Growth, the Arizona Police Association, Arizona Right to Life, and the Arizona Medical Association. He received more than $500,000 from the Club for Growth.
Schweikert lost to freshman incumbent Democrat Harry Mitchell, 53%–44%. He later attributed his defeat on the very bitter primary fight that preceded it.


==== 2010 ====

Schweikert sought a rematch with Mitchell in 2010, with Libertarian Nick Coons also running. Schweikert won the Republican primary on August 24 with 37% of the vote. After having sat out the competitive primary, the Club for Growth again endorsed Schweikert.
On November 2, Schweikert defeated Mitchell, 52%–43%.


==== 2012 ====

After redistricting, the bulk of Schweikert's former territory became the 9th district, while his home in Fountain Hills was drawn into the newly created 4th district. But as soon as the maps were released, Schweikert announced he would run in the 6th district. That district had previously been the 3rd, represented by fellow Republican freshman Ben Quayle. In a statement announcing his reelection plans, Schweikert pointed out that he had grown up in Scottsdale—most of which had been drawn into the 6th as well—had represented it in both the state house and in Congress and owned a second home there. A revised map, however, placed Schweikert's Fountain Hills home in the reconfigured 6th.
Quayle, whose home in Phoenix had been drawn into the 9th but was just outside the boundaries of the 6th, also opted to seek reelection in the 6th. During the bitter primary, Schweikert was widely criticized for a mailer that accused Quayle of "going both ways", suggesting that he was bisexual. On the reverse, the mailer listed issues on which it claimed Quayle had taken both liberal and conservative positions. Senator Jon Kyl, who had represented the district from 1987 to 1995, said that "such campaign tactics insult the voters, degrade politics and expose those who stoop to them as unworthy of high office", and Senator John McCain said the mailer was one of the "worst that I have seen" and that it "crosses the boundary of decent political dialogue and discourse." Quayle's spokeswoman called the mailer "utterly false" and "a sleazy smear tactic." Schweikert's spokesman responded that people "should get their minds out of the gutter" because the mailer was "obviously" referring to "'both ways'—as in liberal and conservative." The Arizona Republic asked two political scientists to review the mailer; both said that they had "never seen anybody accuse someone of flip-flopping [on political issues] that way" and said that it was "difficult to believe" that the sexual suggestion was unintentional.
Although the 6th contained almost two-thirds of Quayle's constituents, Schweikert defeated Quayle in the primary–in what was then a heavily Republican district–53% to 47%. He was reelected with 62% of the vote.


==== 2014 ====

Schweikert was easily reelected in 2014, winning over 60% of the vote.


==== 2016 ====

Schweikert was easily reelected in 2016, winning over 60% of the vote.


==== 2018 ====

In 2018, Democratic tech executive Anita Malik held him to only 55% of the vote despite spending very little money. Malik won 44%, the first time a Democrat had crossed the 40% mark in what is now the 6th since 1976, when Eldon Rudd won election by only 707 votes in what was then the 4th District (the district was numbered as the 3rd from 2003 to 2013, and has been the 6th since 2013).


==== 2020 ====

In 2020, Schweikert was challenged by Democrat Hiral Tipirneni, who had run in the neighboring 8th district two years earlier. The Cook Political Report rated the race a tossup, partly due to the district's changing demographics. According to Cook Political Report, the 6th has the most college graduates in Arizona; in recent years, college graduates had trended away from the GOP. Schweikert defeated Tipirneni with 52% of the vote.


==== 2022 ====

In 2022, Schweikert ran for reelection in the newly redrawn 1st district. He defeated Democratic nominee Jevin Hodge in the general election by less than one percent of the vote.


==== 2024 ====

Schweikert ran for reelection in 2024 against Democratic nominee Amish Shah, an emergency room physician. Schweikert defeated Shah in the November 2024 general election.


=== Tenure ===


==== 116th Congress (2019–2021) ====
Schweikert joined representatives Andy Biggs and Paul Gosar in voting against the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021. He called it "one of the more difficult votes I've ever had to make." While the bill included some components he helped write, he voted against it due to the limited time to read it.
In 2018, the United States House Committee on Ethics launched an investigation into Schweikert and his chief of staff, Oliver Schwab, over funds misuse. On July 30, 2020, Schweikert admitted to 11 violation counts and agreed to an official reprimand by the House and a $50,000 fine. The committee found undisclosed loans and campaign contributions; misuse of campaign contributions for personal use; improper spending by his office; and pressuring staffers to do political work. The House Ethics Committee also faulted him for evasive, misleading, and stalling tactics that helped him skirt more serious violations. The report laid out a "surprisingly sizable amount of misconduct over a seven year period." Schweikert said these were inadvertent errors, but the committee reported that "the weight of the evidence" did not support his contention.


==== 117th Congress (2021–2023) ====
On January 6, 2021, Schweikert was at the U.S. Capitol for the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count during the January 6 United States Capitol attack. Schweikert voted to certify Arizona's votes but voted against certifying Pennsylvania's votes. In the wake of the Capitol attack, Schweikert voted against the second impeachment of Donald Trump. In March 2021, he voted against the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.
As of April 2023, Schweikert had voted in line with President Biden's stated position 12.3% of the time.


=== Committee assignments ===
For the 118th Congress:

Committee on Ways and Means
Subcommittee on Oversight (Chair)
Subcommittee on Social Security
Subcommittee on Tax
The House Republican Steering Committee removed Schweikert from the Committee on Financial Services in late 2012 as part of a larger party leadership-caucus shift. He, Justin Amash and Tim Huelskamp wrote to House Speaker John Boehner asking why they had lost their committee posts. Politico quoted a spokesperson for Representative Lynn Westmoreland saying that Schweikert, Amash and Huelskamp were removed for "their inability to work with other members.": p.2 


=== Caucus memberships ===
Freedom Caucus (left caucus in 2023)
Congressional Western Caucus
U.S.–Japan Caucus
Republican Study Committee
Congressional Coalition on Adoption


== Political positions ==


=== Abortion ===
Schweikert holds an anti-abortion stance and supported the 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. However, when the Arizona Supreme Court upheld a near-total abortion ban in April 2024, Schweikert expressed opposition to the ruling.
Schweikert advocates for the Hyde Amendment, which restricts federal funding for abortion services except in cases of rape, incest, or risk to the mother's life, and supports making this restriction permanent. He also opposes funding for Planned Parenthood and has backed legislation to exclude the organization from any federally funded programs.


=== Cannabis ===
Schweikert has a "B" rating from NORML for his voting record on cannabis-related issues. He supports allowing veterans access to medical cannabis, provided it is legal in their state and recommended by their Veterans Health Administration doctor. He has voted twice in favor of this through the Veterans Equal Access Amendment.


=== Foreign policy ===
In 2016, Schweikert opposed President Obama's proposal to close the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. Schweikert was critical of the Iran nuclear deal, calling it "disastrous." In 2015, Schweikert was one of 26 Republicans to vote against a Republican leadership-sponsored defense spending proposal, voicing concerns about increasing defense expenditures without corresponding budget offsets.
In 2021, Schweikert was among 75 House Republicans who voted against the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022, which would require women to register for the draft.
In 2023, he voted with 47 other Republicans in favor of H.Con.Res. 21, which would have directed President Biden to remove U.S. troops from Syria within 180 days.


=== Gun policy ===
In 2015, he introduced legislation to remove firearm sales and ammunition from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's list of high-risk industries. In 2016, he proposed legislation to remove the District of Columbia's requirement that people seeking concealed carry permits demonstrate a "good reason" to do so.


=== Health care ===
Schweikert has repeatedly voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA). During Republican efforts to replace and repeal the ACA in 2017, he pushed for proposals to repeal more components of the ACA than other members of his party. He played a key role in whipping votes to repeal the ACA, in particular from fellow members of the Freedom Caucus. He has argued that the Affordable Care Act is "an economy killer" because of "the cost it has on companies, taxpayers and individuals".


=== Economic policy ===
Schweikert has been an outspoken critic of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which overhauled financial regulation in the aftermath of the Great Recession, opposing both the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Volcker Rule.
Schweikert supported legislation to reverse a U.S. Department of Labor rule that established a fiduciary standard for retirement and pension advisers, requiring financial advisers to prioritize their clients' financial interests over their own.
In 2011, Schweikert wrote a letter to President Obama asking him to return royalties from U.S. embassies' purchases of books written by the president.
Schweikert opposed the 2011 United States federal budget, objecting to appropriations to expand the Smithsonian Institution, conduct research, and build high-speed rail.
In 2015, Schweikert was one of 17 Republicans to oppose the 2015 United States federal budget, arguing that it did not sufficiently address mandatory spending on entitlement programs. He has called for cutting spending on Medicare and Social Security, arguing that "hard choices" must be made.
Schweikert voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.


=== Iraq ===
In June 2021, Schweikert was one of 49 House Republicans to vote to repeal the 2002 AUMF Against Iraq.


=== Antitrust bill ===
In 2022, Schweikert joined 39 other Republicans in supporting the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act of 2022, a bipartisan antitrust measure designed to address anti-competitive corporate behavior.


== Personal life ==
Schweikert and his wife, Joyce, live in Fountain Hills, Arizona. They adopted a daughter in 2015 and a son in 2022. Schweikert is Roman Catholic.

Andrew Steven Biggs (born November 7, 1958) is an American attorney and politician who represents Arizona's 5th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives. The district, which was once represented by U.S. Senators John McCain and Jeff Flake, is in the heart of the East Valley and includes most of Mesa and Chandler and all of Queen Creek and Biggs's hometown of Gilbert.
A Republican, Biggs was a member of the Arizona House of Representatives from 2003 to 2011 and a member of the Arizona Senate from 2011 to 2017. He was president of the Arizona Senate from 2013 to 2017. In 2016, he was elected to Congress. From 2019 to 2022, Biggs served as chairman of the Freedom Caucus, which includes the House Republican Conference's most conservative members.
On January 21, 2025, Biggs announced his candidacy in the 2026 Arizona gubernatorial election. 


== Early life ==
Biggs was born on November 7, 1958, in Tucson, Arizona. When he was young, Biggs went on a mission to Japan for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and learned to speak fluent Japanese. He later earned his B.A. in Asian studies from Brigham Young University in 1982, his J.D. from the University of Arizona in 1984, and his M.A. in political science from Arizona State University in 1999.
Biggs worked as a lawyer for a firm based in Hobbs, New Mexico, before relocating to Phoenix, where he worked as a prosecutor. In 1993, he won $10 million in the American Family Publishers sweepstakes. He appeared in a TV ad with Dick Clark and Ed McMahon to promote the sweepstakes.


== Arizona State Legislature ==


=== Elections ===
Enabled by $10 million in sweepstakes winnings, which made him financially independent, Biggs decided to run for office.


==== State House of Representatives ====
2002: With Republican Representative Eddie Farnsworth redistricted from District 30, Biggs ran in the five-way September 10 Republican primary, placing second with 5,778 votes. Biggs and Farnsworth were unopposed in the general election, where Biggs took the first seat with 31,812 votes and Farnsworth took the second.
2004: Biggs and Farnsworth were unopposed in the September 7 Republican primary; Farnsworth placed first and Biggs placed second with 11,202 votes. In the three-way general election, Farnsworth took the first seat and Biggs the second with 51,932 votes, ahead of Libertarian candidate Wade Reynolds.
2006: Biggs and Farnsworth were challenged in the four-way September 12 Republican primary; Farnsworth placed first and Biggs placed second with 7,793 votes. In the three-way general election, Farnsworth took the first seat and Biggs the second with 38,085 votes, ahead of Libertarian candidate Edward Schwebel.
2008: With Farnsworth running for Arizona Senate and leaving a House District 22 seat open, Biggs ran in the four-way September 2 Republican primary, placing first with 9,800 votes. Biggs and fellow Republican nominee Laurin Hendrix won the general election, where Biggs took the first seat with 59,615 votes and Hendrix the second, ahead of Democratic nominee Glenn Ray, who had run for the district's senate seat in 2006.


==== State Senate ====
2010: When Republican Senator Thayer Verschoor ran for State Treasurer of Arizona and left the Senate District 22 seat open, Biggs was unopposed in both the August 24 Republican primary, winning with 25,792 votes, and the November 2 general election, winning with 59,933 votes.
2012: Redistricted to District 12, and with incumbent Republican Senator John B. Nelson redistricted to District 13, Biggs was unopposed in both the August 28 Republican primary, winning with 19,844 votes, and the November 6 general election, winning with 63,812 votes.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===
In 2016, Biggs ran for Congress from the 5th District to replace retiring Representative Matt Salmon. He led the field in the four-way Republican primary, finishing nine votes ahead of his nearest opponent, businesswoman Christine Jones. A recanvass boosted Biggs's margin to 16 votes, and an automatic recount confirmed him as the nominee by 27 votes. His primary victory virtually assured him of being the next representative from the district; the 5th and its predecessors have been in Republican hands for all but one term since 1953.
Biggs defeated Democratic nominee Talia Fuentes, 64.1% to 35.9%. He was not required to give up his state senate seat under Arizona's resign-to-run laws, since he was in the last year of what would have been his final term in the chamber.


=== Tenure ===
Biggs is a member of the Congressional Western Caucus and the Republican Study Committee. In September 2019, he replaced Mark Meadows as chair of the Freedom Caucus.
Biggs voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. After the vote, he said the bill would "provide much-needed economic relief" to American citizens and businesses.
On March 4, 2020, Ken Buck and Biggs were the only two representatives to vote against an $8.3 billion emergency aid package meant to help the U.S. respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. In a statement, Biggs called the bill "larded-up" and "bloated". Ten days later, he voted against the larger Coronavirus Response Act, which passed the House, 363–40. Biggs said he opposed the second bill because it provided benefits to domestic partners and thereby "redefined the family".


==== Contesting the 2020 presidential election ====
In 2020, Biggs joined Representative Paul Gosar in a video claiming there was widespread voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election. They claimed that Arizona's voting machines were faulty, and Biggs claimed that poll watchers were allowed to participate in vote tabulations in Detroit. They also demanded an audit of Maricopa County's vote count. Later, Biggs claimed that 10,000 Maricopa County voters were "disenfranchised" without giving evidence.
In December 2020, Biggs was among 126 House Republicans to sign an amicus brief for Texas v. Pennsylvania, an unsuccessful lawsuit that asked the Supreme Court to overturn election results from Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, thereby denying Joe Biden from taking office as president.
Biggs also spoke at rallies promoting the "Stop the Steal" election conspiracy movement, and has claimed antifa was behind the January 6, 2021, storming of the U.S. Capitol. He denied that he was involved in planning the event and the riots as alleged by Rolling Stone and a video posted by Stop the Steal organizer Ali Alexander. In a deposition to the January 6 committee of the House of Representatives, Alexander testified that he spoke in person with Biggs before the events.
On October 7, 2021, Biggs again falsely claimed that "we don't know who won Arizona in the 2020 presidential election".


==== 2021 attack on the United States Capitol ====
During the 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, Biggs and all other House members were ushered to a secure location when the House chamber was cleared. A video of Biggs later surfaced in which he refused to wear a face mask during the COVID-19 pandemic, a violation of House rules. Sources noted that after the siege lockdown, during which several other congressional Republicans also refused to wear masks, three House Democrats tested positive for the disease. Biggs subsequently voted to object to Arizona's and Pennsylvania's electoral votes that day, joining 146 House Republicans.
On January 12, 2021, Biggs called on Representative Liz Cheney to resign from her leadership position in the Republican caucus after she voted in favor of Donald Trump's second impeachment.
In the aftermath of the events on January 6, Biggs's brothers William and Daniel wrote a letter to the editor of The Arizona Republic demanding their brother's removal from office. They wrote that Biggs is "at least partially to blame" for the Capitol storming. They also condemned his refusal to wear a mask in the secure location. According to William and Daniel Biggs, this "was a passive-aggressive tantrum and the ultimate disrespect for all present".
Biggs was one of 12 House Republicans to vote against H.R 1085 to award three Congressional Gold Medals to the U.S. Capitol Police who protected the Capitol on January 6. In June 2021, he and 20 other House Republicans voted against a similar resolution.
The House committee investigating the January 6 attack subpoenaed Biggs on May 12, 2022. During the committee hearing on June 21, 2022, Speaker of the Arizona House Russell Bowers testified that Biggs called him on the morning of January 6 asking him to sign a letter calling for decertification of the Arizona electors. On June 23, 2022, witnesses confirmed that Biggs had asked for a presidential pardon for his activities related to the certification of the vote.


==== Foreign and defense policy ====
Biggs was among 60 Republicans to oppose condemning Trump's action of withdrawing forces from Syria. He, Matt Gaetz, and a handful of other Republicans broke with their party and voted to end Saudi assistance to the War in Yemen.
On March 19, 2021, Biggs voted against a House resolution to condemn the military coup in Myanmar. The resolution passed, 398–14, with one other member, Paul Gosar, voting present. Biggs called the violence "tragic" but added that "there is suffering everywhere in the world" and the U.S. "can't be the military police for the entire world", claiming the resolution was a way to "put our foot in the door in Burma." The resolution was symbolic and did not call for use of force.
In June 2021, Biggs was one of 49 House Republicans to vote to repeal the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002.
Biggs was one of 15 representatives to vote against H.R. 567: Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership Program Act of 2021, which would establish an interagency program to assist countries in North and West Africa to improve immediate and long-term capabilities to counter terrorist threats, and for other purposes.
In July 2021, Biggs voted against the bipartisan ALLIES Act, which would increase by 8,000 the number of special immigrant visas for Afghan allies of the U.S. military during its invasion of Afghanistan, while also reducing some application requirements that caused long application backlogs; the bill passed the House, 407–16.
In September 2021, Biggs was among 75 House Republicans to vote against the National Defense Authorization Act of 2022, which contains a provision that would require women to be drafted.

During the 117th Congress, Biggs also co-sponsored two resolutions to impeach Attorney General Merrick Garland.


==== 2023 Speaker election ====

Biggs ran in the Republican conference election for Speaker of the House of Representatives against Kevin McCarthy, then the House Minority Leader. McCarthy defeated him, 188 votes to 31. In the 2023 Speaker election, fellow Freedom Caucus member Paul Gosar nominated Biggs. He received 10 votes on the first ballot, which, alongside nine votes for other Republican candidates, was enough to necessitate a second ballot. This made the 2023 election the first to take more than one ballot since 1923. Biggs was not nominated for the second ballot, and voted for Jim Jordan. He did not receive any votes on ballots 2 through 13, but received 2 votes on the 14th ballot despite not being nominated.


==== Removal of Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House ====
On October 3, 2023, Biggs was one of eight Republicans who voted to remove Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House; during the debate which preceded the vote, Biggs had criticized McCarthy for allowing the passage of a temporary spending bill which did not include provisions to enhance border security.

Committee on Oversight and Accountability

Subcommittee on National Security, the Border, and Foreign Affairs
Committee on the Judiciary
Subcommittee on Crime and Federal Government Surveillance (Chair)
Subcommittee on Immigration Integrity, Security, and Enforcement


=== Caucus memberships ===
Freedom Caucus
Congressional Western Caucus


== Political positions ==
During the first presidency of Donald Trump, Biggs voted in line with the president's stated position 82.9% of the time. During Biden's presidency, Biggs has voted in line with the president's stated position 5.1% of the time.
Biggs chairs the Freedom Caucus, which has been described as right-wing populist.


=== Abortion ===
Biggs is "opposed to all forms of elective abortion". He has argued in favor of abolishing the filibuster to make it easier to pass anti-abortion laws. He has attended a conference hosted by the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group. He supported the 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade, calling it "a major victory for the unborn".
Biggs has received ratings divided down the aisle from special interest groups focused on abortion. In 2019, he received a 0% rating from NARAL Pro-Choice America. He has a 15% lifetime rating from Planned Parenthood, which supports legal access to abortion, and a 100% rating from Campaign for Working Families, which opposes legal abortion.


=== Article V convention ===
Biggs opposes a convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution, also known as an Article V convention. During his tenure as Arizona Senate president, Biggs blocked a resolution calling for a convention. In 2015, Biggs published a book, The Con of the Con-Con, arguing against a convention.


=== Climate change ===
In comments at an April 2017 constituent town hall, frequently interrupted by boos, Biggs rejected the scientific consensus on climate change, asserting in a halting answer, "There are credible scientists who say it exists; we aren't sure why", and "there are credible scientists who say it doesn't." Replying to a candidate survey from The Arizona Republic, Biggs wrote, "I do not believe climate change is occurring. I do not think that humans have a significant impact on climate. The federal government should stop regulating and stomping on our economy and freedoms in the name of a discredited theory." He submitted an amendment to the 2018 spending bill that would defund the National Climate Assessment and urged President Trump to withdraw from the Paris Accords. In February 2020, when Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy attempted to make a modest effort to gather the support of concerned young voters via a restrained approach to address climate change, Biggs and other hardline denialists objected. Biggs said: "People are like, 'Is this an official rollout? It can't be official. We didn't vote on it'."
While factions of the Republican Party were split on whether to continue climate change denial, conservative groups such as the Club for Growth and the Competitive Enterprise Institute supported continuation. In 2018, Biggs was the sole House member to receive a 100% rating from the CFG.


=== COVID-19 ===

Biggs opposes wearing masks to prevent the transmission of COVID-19, encouraging Arizonans not to wear them. In July 2020, he tweeted that people should not trust Anthony Fauci or Deborah Birx. He has called for the White House Coronavirus Task Force to be disbanded. During a major outbreak in the summer of 2020 in Arizona, Biggs questioned the hospitalization numbers and called Governor Doug Ducey's two-month lockdown a result of "hysteria" from "Democratic Leftists." In September 2020, Biggs posted a series of tweets supporting the use of hydroxychloroquine to prevent COVID-19. There is no strong evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19.
On March 4, 2020, Biggs and Ken Buck were the only two representatives to vote against an $8.3 billion COVID-19 aid package. Biggs called the bill "larded-up" and "bloated". Ten days later, he voted against the larger Coronavirus Response Act, saying that because it provided benefits to domestic partners, it "redefined the family." In December 2020, Biggs called on Trump to veto the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, which included $900 billion in stimulus relief for the pandemic. The legislation was the first bill to address the pandemic since April 2020.


=== Healthcare ===
In 2018, Biggs sponsored a bill "designed to let very sick patients request access to experimental medicines without government oversight", which passed the House, 267–149. Biggs said the bill was "not false hope; it is hope."


=== Juneteenth ===
In June 2021, Biggs was among 14 House Republicans who voted against passing legislation to establish June 19, or Juneteenth, as a federal holiday.


=== LGBT rights ===
Biggs is a former policy advisor to United Families International, a nonprofit that opposes same-sex marriage. Biggs condemned the Supreme Court ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, which held that same-sex marriage bans violated the US constitution.


=== Net neutrality ===
Biggs has gone on record as opposing net neutrality, and favored FCC Chairman Ajit Pai's plan to end it. In a letter to his constituents, Biggs wrote, "we should allow the free market to expand the internet and its services." He has accepted $19,500 in campaign donations from the telecommunications industry.


=== Robert Mueller ===
On June 23, 2017, Biggs was one of three Republicans who called for the resignation of Robert Mueller, the prosecutor investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, on the grounds that Mueller could not conduct his investigation fairly because of events that happened when he was the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigations.
On March 19, 2018, Biggs renewed his call for Mueller to resign. On July 25, 2018, Biggs and nine other Republicans co-sponsored a resolution to impeach Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who was Mueller's direct supervisor after the recusal of Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
On April 8, 2019, The Arizona Republic published an op-ed by Biggs on the initial findings of the Mueller investigation. In it, Biggs called the investigation "an illegitimate attack on the executive branch" and wrote that the findings "demonstrate the weakness of the initial premise to investigate Trump, his family and campaign staff." He blamed the investigation on "the media that fueled this bogus attempt to overthrow the will of the American voter." Biggs's op-ed was published well ahead of the release of Mueller's full report on April 18, 2019, and was most likely written in response to a four-page summary of the report by Attorney General William Barr released on March 24. After the publication of the full report, Biggs posted a video on Twitter declaring that there was "no basis for an obstruction [of justice] charge" against Trump, chastising the Democratic party for attempting to "undermine the POTUS".


=== Texting while driving ===
In 2017, Biggs used his powers as transportation chair and president of the Arizona State Senate to block a bill banning driving while texting for holders of a learning permit.


=== 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund ===
In 2019, Biggs was one of 11 House Republicans to oppose funding for the September 11 Victims Compensation Fund bill H.R. 1327. On July 12, 2019, the measure passed the House, 402–12.


=== Immigration ===
Biggs voted against the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act of 2019 which would amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to eliminate the per-country numerical limitation for employment-based immigrants, to increase the per-country numerical limitation for family-sponsored immigrants, and for other purposes.
Biggs voted against the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020 which authorizes DHS to nearly double the available H-2B visas for the remainder of FY 2020.
Biggs voted against Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1158) which effectively prohibits ICE from cooperating with Health and Human Services to detain or remove illegal alien sponsors of unaccompanied alien children (UACs).


=== Israel ===
Biggs voted to provide Israel with support following 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.


=== Big Tech ===
In 2022, Biggs was one of 39 Republicans to vote for the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act of 2022, an antitrust package that would crack down on corporations for anti-competitive behavior.


=== 2023 United States debt-ceiling crisis ===

=== Tenure ===
On January 5, 2011, Crawford was sworn into office as a member of the 112th Congress. He is the first Republican to represent his district since Reconstruction. The last Republican to represent the district was Asa Hodges, who vacated the seat on March 3, 1875. Crawford is a member of the Republican Study Committee.
In 2010, Crawford signed a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity to vote against any global warming legislation that would raise taxes.
Crawford supported President Donald Trump's 2017 executive order to impose a ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, saying that the order was "designed to keep our nation safer" but that "Green card holders and aides of the U.S. military should be allowed entry."
Crawford voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. He believed the bill would make it easier for people to file their taxes and that "the vast majority of middle-income families in my district will get to keep more of their money to use as they wish." He also believed that local businesses would hire more and raise employees' pay in the wake of the bill's implementation.
In 2019, Crawford received a death threat from James Powell, a 43-year-old Arkansas resident. Powell was charged with "first-degree terroristic threatening" after an investigation by U.S. Capitol Police and the FBI. The charge carries a maximum six-year prison sentence and $10,000 fine.
Crawford opposed Obergefell v. Hodges, the Supreme Court ruling that same-sex marriage bans are unconstitutional.
In December 2020, Crawford was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.
As of October 2021, Crawford had voted in line with Joe Biden's stated position 7.5% of the time.
Crawford voted to provide Israel with support following 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.


==== Immigration ====

The legislation would establish a wage floor for the high-skill H-1B visa program, thereby significantly reducing employer dependence on the program. The bill would also eliminate the Optional Practical Training program that allows foreign graduates to stay and work in the United States.


=== Legislation ===
On January 18, 2013, Crawford introduced the Farmers Undertake Environmental Land Stewardship Act (H.R. 311; 113th Congress). The bill would require the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to modify the Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure (SPCC) rule, which regulates oil discharges into navigable waters and adjoining shorelines. The rule requires certain farmers to develop an oil spill prevention plan certified by a professional engineer and may require them to make infrastructure changes. According to supporters, the bill would "ease the burden placed on farmers and ranchers" by making it easier for smaller farms to self-certify and raising the level of storage capacity under which farms are exempted.


=== Veterans ===
The PACT ACT which expanded VA benefits to veterans exposed to toxic chemicals during their military service, received a "nay" from Crawford. Regarding cannabis, despite lobbying from VSOs such as the DAV Crawford also voted against 2022 MORE Act.

Stephen Allen Womack ( WOH-mack; born February 18, 1957) is an American politician serving as the U.S. representative for Arkansas's 3rd congressional district since 2011. The district, which was once represented by former Senator J. William Fulbright, covers much of northwestern Arkansas, including Fort Smith, Fayetteville, Springdale, and Womack's hometown of Rogers. A member of the Republican Party, Womack was mayor of Rogers before his election to Congress.
Womack chaired the House Budget Committee from 2018 to 2019, and was its ranking member from 2019 to 2021.


== Early life, education and career before politics ==

Womack was born in Russellville, Arkansas. His parents were Elisabeth (née Canerday) and James Womack. Womack graduated from Russellville High School in 1975.
He graduated with a B.A. in communications from Arkansas Tech University in 1979. That same year, his father founded KURM-AM. Womack served as station manager. Also in 1979, he enlisted in the Arkansas Army National Guard.
He left the radio station in 1990 and became executive officer for the Arkansas Reserve Officers' Training Corps at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville. He left that role in 1996. He then became a financial consultant for Merrill Lynch, while still serving in the national guard. He retired from the national guard in 2009 as a colonel.


== Entry into politics ==
In 1998, Womack was elected mayor of Rogers, Arkansas, holding the post for 12 years. During his mayoralty, Womack sought to crack down on illegal immigration by assigning two Immigration and Naturalization Service agents to the Rogers Police Department. As a result, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund filed a class-action suit against the city's police force, accusing it of racial profiling.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 2010 ====

In late 2009, Womack jumped into the race for the 3rd District after incumbent Representative John Boozman announced that he would run for the United States Senate. The 3rd is one of the most Republican districts in the South and the nation (Republicans have held it since 1967), and it was generally believed that whoever won the Republican primary would be the district's next representative. Womack ranked first in the seven-candidate primary with 31% of the vote. In the June runoff, he defeated state Senator and fellow Rogers resident Cecile Bledsoe, 52%-48%.
In the general election, Womack defeated Democratic nominee David Whitaker, 72%-28%.


==== 2012 ====

Womack was originally set to face veteran Ken Aden in his reelection bid, but Aden withdrew from the race on July 8, after admitting to exaggerating his military record. As it was too late to select a replacement candidate for Aden (under Arkansas law, the Democratic Party could only name a replacement at that date if the original candidate died, moved out of the district or opted to seek another office), Womack faced no major-party opposition in November. He was reelected with 76% of the vote, defeating Rebekah Kennedy (Green Party of the United States, 16%) and David Pangrac (Libertarian Party (United States), 8%).


==== 2014 ====

Thomas Brewer, a math teacher and minister, originally announced he was challenging Womack for the Republican nomination, and Troy Gittings, a high school English teacher and stand-up comedian, had announced he was running for the Democratic nomination. But neither Brewer nor Gittings ended up filing, leaving Libertarian Grant Brand as Womack's only challenger. He was reelected with 79% of the vote to Brand's 21%.


==== 2016 ====

Womack again faced no Democratic candidate in the general election. He defeated Libertarian Steve Isaacson 77%-23%.


==== 2018 ====

Womack faced a Republican primary challenge from Robb Ryerse, a self-described "progressive Republican." He defeated Ryerse, 84%-16%.
In the general election, Womack faced Democratic opposition for the first time as an incumbent. Womack defeated Josh Mahoney, president of the Arkansas Single Parent Scholarship Fund and former chairman of the Fayetteville Airport Commission, and Libertarian Michael Kalagias, on election day, 65%-33%-2%, his smallest margin of victory to date.


==== 2020 ====

Womack did not face a challenge in the Republican primary, and he defeated the Democratic nominee, nurse practitioner Celeste Williams, and Kalagias, 64%-32%-4%.


==== 2022 ====

Womack won reelection against Democratic nominee, Lauren Mallett-Hays, and Kalagias, with 63.7% to 32.9% and 3.4%.


==== 2024 ====

Womack faced a primary challenge from state senator Clint Penzo. Womack narrowly defeated Penzo, receiving 54%.


=== Tenure ===

In 2010, Womack signed a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity promising to vote against any global warming legislation that would raise taxes.
Womack was a member of the House Appropriations Committee when in 2014 lawmakers inserted a prohibition into an appropriations bill that would prevent USDA staff from working on finishing regulations related to the meat industry.
In a 2015 episode of his show Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, John Oliver criticized Womack for blocking the enforcement of laws proposed by the Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration that were designed to protect chicken farmers from being threatened or punished by the companies they work for if they spoke out regarding their farming experiences.
In 2015, Womack condemned the Supreme Court ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, which held that same-sex marriage bans violated the constitution.
In December 2017, Womack voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.
Womack did not join the majority of Republican members of Congress who signed an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election. Womack voted to certify both Arizona's and Pennsylvania's results in the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count.  On May 19, 2021, Womack was one of 35 Republicans to join all 217 Democrats present in voting to approve legislation to establish the January 6 commission meant to investigate the storming of the U.S. Capitol.
On November 30, Womack voted in favor of H.R. 550: Immunization Infrastructure Modernization Act of 2021. The bill helps create confidential, population-based databases that maintain a record of vaccine administrations.
As of October 2021, Womack had voted in line with Joe Biden's stated position 15% of the time.
In 2022, Womack was one of 39 Republicans to vote for the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act of 2022, an antitrust package that would crack down on corporations for anti-competitive behavior.
A staunch Kevin McCarthy ally, Womack presided over the process to remove McCarthy as Speaker he opposed, in the October 2023 Speaker of the House election, Womack along with over 20 of his Republican colleagues voted for Steve Scalise in protest over Jim Jordan for the first three ballots before voting for Mike Johnson in the fourth and final ballot.

Douglas Lee LaMalfa ( lə-MAL-fə; born July 2, 1960) is an American politician serving as the U.S. representative for California's 1st congressional district since 2013. A member of the Republican Party, his district, formerly the second-largest in the state after the 8th (now largely the 23rd), covers nearly all of interior Northern California, including Chico, Redding, and Susanville.
A native of Oroville, LaMalfa was the California State Assemblyman for the 2nd district from 2002 to 2008 and California State Senator from the 4th district from 2010 to 2012.


== Early life, education, and career ==
LaMalfa is a fourth-generation rice farmer and lifelong Northern California resident. He graduated from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo with a Bachelor's degree in agricultural business.


== California Assembly ==


=== Elections ===
In 2002, LaMalfa ran for the California Assembly in the 2nd District. He won the Republican primary with 59% of the vote, and the general election with 67%. He was reelected in 2004 (68%) and 2006 (68%).


=== Tenure ===

LaMalfa worked with Bernie Richter as an early supporter of Proposition 209, which ended affirmative action in California. He worked for passage of the Protection of Marriage Act, Proposition 22, which banned same-sex marriage in California, and after the California Supreme Court overturned that initiative in In re Marriage Cases, he was an early supporter of and active in the Proposition 8 campaign, an initiative that would overturn the court ruling and again ban same-sex marriage. In June 2008, he urged voters to approve Proposition 8, saying "This is an opportunity to take back a little bit of dignity ... for kids, for all of us in California. It really disturbs me that the will of the people was overridden by four members of the Supreme Court."
LaMalfa opposed Mike Feuer's microstamping bill, AB 1471, which Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed into law on October 13, 2007.
LaMalfa was a co-author of ACA 20, which would empower law enforcement to act as Immigration, Customs Enforcement Agents and would have cracked down on illegal immigration.
In 2007, LaMalfa successfully passed AB 1645, a law that would prevent seizures of firearms in the event of an emergency or natural disaster. This was the first pro-gun legislation passed and signed into law in a decade. When he was named the California Rifle and Pistol Association's "Legislator of the Year" for 2007, LaMalfa said, "Receiving this award today from the California Rifle and Pistol Association is a truly humbling honor."


=== Committee assignments ===
Joint Committee on Legislative Audit
Public Safety
West Nile virus


== California Senate ==


=== 2010 election ===
In 2010, LaMalfa ran for the California State Senate in the 4th District. In the Republican primary, he defeated State Assemblyman Rick Keene 58%–42%. In the general election, he defeated Lathe Gill 68%–32%.


=== Tenure ===
In November 2011, LaMalfa opposed a proposed bullet train, saying, "In light of the High Speed Rail plan that was submitted and that the numbers still do not work, California in this dire fiscal crisis that we're in, we're going to introduce legislation to repeal the HSR Authority and the funding for that the state was going to put forward".
LaMalfa opposed a bill that would require history teachers in all California public schools to teach history of homosexuality and gay civil rights. He said that Governor Jerry Brown was "out of touch with what I think are still mainstream American values. That's not the kind of stuff I want my kids learning about in public school. They've really crossed a line into a new frontier."
LaMalfa strongly opposed the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, which would bypass the Electoral College, saying, "I think this is dangerous. It flies in the face of 220 years of election law. We have an electoral college; it was put there for a reason."


=== Committee assignments ===
Agriculture
Budget and Fiscal Review
Elections and Constitutional Amendments (Vice Chair)
Governance and Finance
Natural Resources and Water (Vice Chair)
Veterans Affairs
Joint Committee on Legislative Audit
Joint Committee on Fairs, Allocation, and Classification (Chair)

== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 2012 ====

In January 2012, 2nd district Congressman Wally Herger announced that he was retiring after 13 terms. Hours after his announcement, Republican consultant Dave Gilliard told Flash Report that Herger had endorsed LaMalfa as his successor. Herger's district was renumbered the 1st in the 2010 round of redistricting. LaMalfa's state senate district was largely coextensive with the western portion of the congressional district.
LaMalfa finished first in the June 2012 Republican primary election with 38% of the vote in an eight-person race, winning 10 of the district's 11 counties.
On November 6, 2012, LaMalfa defeated Democratic Party nominee Jim Reed 57%–43%.


==== 2014 ====

LaMalfa defeated Democratic nominee Heidi Hall in the general election with 61% of the vote.


==== 2016 ====

In the 2016 general election, LaMalfa defeated Democratic nominee Jim Reed with 59.1% of the vote.


==== 2018 ====

There were many candidates in the primary contest, including four candidates expressing preference for the Democratic party, two candidates expressing preference for the Republican party (including LaMalfa), and one candidate expressing preference for the Green Party of the United States. LaMalfa and Audrey Denney (who preferred the Democratic party) were the top two candidates in the primary, earning 51.7% and 17.9% of the vote respectively.
During the general election, LaMalfa's campaign sent out an attack mailer showing a falsified picture of Denney signing a document endorsing Nancy Pelosi and liberal Democrats. In February 2018, Denney uploaded the original photograph to her campaign website; it showed her signing a promise to oppose campaign contributions from the petroleum industry. LaMalfa's campaign altered the wording on the document in its mailer.
LaMalfa defeated Denney in the November 6 general election, with 54.9% of the 291,594 votes cast to Denney's 45.1%.


==== 2020 ====

LaMalfa defeated Denney in a general-election rematch with 57.0% of the vote to her 43.0%.


==== 2022 ====

LaMalfa defeated Max Steiner, who described himself as a "moderate Democrat", with 62.1% of the 246,225 votes cast to Steiner's 37.9%.  During the campaign, Steiner attacked LaMalfa's support for election fraud claims and his vote against certifying President Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election.
In the 2022 race, 63% of LaMalfa's campaign contributions came from inside his state, with 25% coming from inside his district.


==== 2024 ====

LaMalfa defeated Democratic candidate Rose Penelope Yee with 65.3% of the vote.


=== Committee assignments ===
For the 118th Congress:

Committee on Agriculture
Subcommittee on Forestry (Chair)
Subcommittee on General Farm Commodities, Risk Management, and Credit
Committee on Natural Resources
Subcommittee on Indian and Insular Affairs
Subcommittee on Water, Wildlife and Fisheries
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure
Subcommittee on Highways and Transit
Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials
Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment


=== Caucus memberships ===
Congressional Western Caucus
Republican Study Committee
U.S.-Japan Caucus
Congressional Coalition on Adoption


== Political positions ==


=== Abortion ===
LaMalfa supported the overturning of Roe v. Wade. He called Roe v. Wade "partisan" and said it "does not represent the values of our country." LaMalfa voted in favor of the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. As of the 118th Congress, LaMalfa was given the rating of A+ by the Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America.


=== Climate change ===
Public statements made by LaMalfa have demonstrated a misinterpretation or misunderstanding of climate change. In a back and forth with Transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg, LaMalfa conflated the climate with the seasons. “This one called is autumn, sir”, he said in response to Buttigieg saying that we are already experiencing the effects of the climate changing.
LaMalfa has said, "The climate of the globe has been fluctuating since God created it", and that the Book of Genesis disproves the scientific consensus on climate change, which he has called "bad science". In 2017, he said, "I don't buy the idea that man-made activity is responsible." In 2018, amid wildfires, LaMalfa said, "I'm not going to quibble here today about whether it's man, or sunspot activity, or magma causing ice shelves to melt." He suggested the wildfires were due to poor land management by state and federal agencies.
LaMalfa's February 2024 claim that CO2 cannot cause climate change—because it is only 0.04% of the atmosphere—was soon fact-checked as false and misleading, given the scientifically known strong effect of even small concentrations of that greenhouse gas on climate.


=== Donald Trump ===

During President Donald Trump's first impeachment, LaMalfa voted against impeachment, believing that Trump did not do anything that warranted impeachment, including during his phone call with the President of Ukraine.
After Trump lost the 2020 election and refused to concede, LaMalfa claimed that "the circumstances surrounding this presidential election point to a fraudulent outcome." In December 2020, LaMalfa was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives who signed an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a statement that called signing the amicus brief an act of "election subversion."
On January 7, 2021, following the storming of the U.S. Capitol building by Trump supporters, LaMalfa and six other California representatives voted to reject the certification of Arizona's and Pennsylvania's electoral votes in the 2020 presidential election.


=== Race ===
After the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, LaMalfa stayed silent on the matter for five days until finally expressing disappointment upon being questioned on the incident.
After the passing of a defense spending bill with a provision aiming to weed out white supremacy from military and federal law enforcement, LaMalfa expressed concerns it would turn into a witch hunt and that racism will always exist. He also claimed it is not Congress's job to deal with racism in the government.
In June 2021, LaMalfa was one of 14 House Republicans to vote against legislation to establish Juneteenth, a celebration of the end of slavery, as a federal holiday. The House passed the resolution with a vote of 415-14, while it passed in the Senate 100-0.


=== Joe Biden ===
As of October 2021, LaMalfa had voted in line with Joe Biden's stated position 9.3% of the time.


=== Farming ===

From 1995 to 2016, LaMalfa's own farm received the largest amount of public assistance money from agricultural subsidies (over $1.7 million) in the history of Congress. As a member of the House Agricultural Committee, LaMalfa oversees farm subsidies, presenting a conflict of interest. In 2017, his spokesman, Parker Williams, said that LaMalfa "voted to end direct farm subsidy payments in the very first farm bill he worked on" and that a new farm bill proposed does not provide subsidies for rice grown in California, a crop that LaMalfa farms. He supported the 2020–2021 Indian farmers' protest.


=== LGBT rights ===
LaMalfa opposes same-sex marriage and has said that legalizing it would "open the floodgates" for polygamy to be legalized. He has said that marriage is "an institution created by God and supposed to be held up and respected by men and women." He endorsed the First Amendment Defense Act, which he claim would "protect the nonprofit status of religious institutions if the federal government tried to compel them to act against their faith." In 2015, LaMalfa co-sponsored a resolution to amend the Constitution to ban same-sex marriage. On July 19, 2022, he voted against the Respect for Marriage Act, a bill that would protect the right to same-sex marriage at a federal level.


=== Voter fraud ===
LaMalfa has said, "California is just a sieve on its voter security." Speaking about his own district, he said, "There's a percentage of illegal votes, probably in every district. Is it high here? Probably not. We don't really have the demographics that would be a really big push of that."


=== Taxes ===
LaMalfa voted in favor of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. According to him, the bill will enable his constituents to save more money and give them tax relief. He said that the bill will give a "booster shot to the U.S. economy", enable businesses to hire more workers, and cause more products to be made in the USA, especially in Redding.


=== Colleagues ===
In November 2021, after Representative Paul Gosar shared an animated video of himself killing Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and attacking President Biden, LaMalfa voted against Gosar's censure.


=== Defense ===
In September 2021, LaMalfa was among 75 House Republicans to vote against the National Defense Authorization Act of 2022, which contains a provision that would require women to be drafted.


=== Crime ===
LaMalfa has expressed support for prosecuting minors charged with felonies as adults and has supported the construction of additional juvenile detention centers.


=== Education ===
LaMalfa supports posting the Ten Commandments in public schools. In 2013, he co-sponsored the Abstinence Education Reallocation Act, which sought to teach abstinence in public schools.


=== Immigration ===
LaMalfa sponsored H.R. 6202, the American Tech Workforce Act of 2021, introduced by Representative Jim Banks. The legislation would establish a wage floor for the high-skill H-1B visa program, thereby significantly reducing employer dependence on the program. The bill would also eliminate the Optional Practical Training program that allows foreign graduates to stay and work in the United States.


=== Ukraine ===
In August 2023 Doug LaMalfa was the sole California Republican to vote in favor of Amendment 22 of H.R. 2670 to prohibit all security assistance to Ukraine. Additionally LaMalfa was the only California Republican to vote for Amendment 21 to cancel $300 million of assistance for Ukraine.


== Electoral history ==


== Personal life ==
LaMalfa is married to Jill LaMalfa. They have four children. LaMalfa commutes weekly from California to Washington, D.C. He is an owner and manager of the DSL LaMalfa Family Partnership, which owns and operates the family rice farm in Richvale, California. LaMalfa employs a farm manager who runs the farm while he is in Washington.
LaMalfa has donated over $100,000 to his own campaigns and other Republican Party causes and candidates. As of 2018, he has a net worth of nearly $3.5 million.
LaMalfa is a Christian.

Kevin Patrick Kiley (born January 30, 1985) is an American politician, attorney, and former educator serving as the U.S. representative for California's 3rd congressional district since 2023. A member of the Republican Party, he represented the 6th district in the California State Assembly from 2016 to 2022. Kiley was one of 53 candidates to replace California governor Gavin Newsom in the voter-initiated recall election on September 14, 2021.


== Early life, education, and career ==
Kiley grew up in the Sacramento area, where his father was a physician and his mother was a special education teacher. He attended local public schools, including Cavitt Junior High School and Granite Bay High School, where he was valedictorian.
Kiley graduated with an undergraduate degree from Harvard University in 2007, completing a thesis titled "The Civil Rights Movement and the Reemergence of Classical Democracy". Upon graduation, he became a teacher in Los Angeles through Teach for America, teaching for two years at Manual Arts High School while earning his teaching credentials at Loyola Marymount University.
Kiley later attended Yale Law School, worked as an editor of the Yale Law Journal, and clerked at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. He returned to California to join the law firm Irell & Manella, where he helped prepare an intellectual property theft case for T-Mobile against Chinese technology company Huawei that was the basis for a federal criminal investigation. He was an adjunct professor at the University of the Pacific McGeorge School of Law.


== Political career ==

In 2016, Kiley was elected to the California State Assembly. In May 2016, Kiley told The Sacramento Bee that he supported then-Ohio Governor John Kasich in the 2016 United States presidential election. In 2018, Kiley authored legislation to make it easier for students to transfer school districts.
After winning a second term in the State Assembly, Kiley ran for the State Senate in California's 1st District. He finished second in the primary, but lost the runoff to fellow Assemblyman Brian Dahle. Soon after the start of the new legislative session, Kiley introduced legislation to close for private use a controversial DMV office that catered exclusively to state legislators and staff. In a statement to The Sacramento Bee, Kiley said: "This is supposed to be a government of the people, by the people and for the people, not an oligarchy where a gilded political class enjoys privileges that aren’t available to the people that we represent."
According to the Associated Press, Kiley is "a conservative who often flirts with the fringes of the GOP". He has said climate change is real, but opposed Governor Gavin Newsom's executive orders requiring all new vehicles in California to be zero emission by 2035 and banning oil-drilling by 2045. He is a supporter of charter schools. Kiley introduced legislation to ban local and state governments from implementing vaccine requirements. After Joe Biden won the 2020 election and Donald Trump refused to concede while making claims of fraud, Kiley refused to say whether Biden won the 2020 election legitimately. Kiley has said his position is to "stay out of national politics altogether", and that "national politics is a distraction that is used frankly by those in power in Sacramento [as] kind of a smokescreen for their own failures."
In March 2024, former FEC chairperson, Ann Ravel, filed a complaint against Kevin Kiley "alleging he excessively used campaign funds to support a conservative coalition seeking to roll back parts of Proposition 47."


=== 2021 California gubernatorial recall election ===

Though he voted to authorize $1 billion of emergency pandemic spending for Governor Newsom in March 2020, saying "to trust in Governor Newsom’s leadership and listen to his guidance", Kiley later said Newsom "made a mockery of that trust" and, alongside fellow California legislator James Gallagher, sued in June 2020 to remove Newsom's emergency powers. Kiley lost the case on appeal. Kiley published a book in January 2021 titled Recall Gavin Newsom: The Case Against America's Most Corrupt Governor.
On July 6, 2021, Kiley announced his candidacy for governor of California in the 2021 recall election. According to the New York Times, he was one of the "more moderate Republican recall candidates," while the Los Angeles Times deemed him and John Cox the "more traditional conservatives" in the election, which failed to remove Newsom from office.
Kiley indicated his support for school choice during the campaign and said teachers' unions in the state were too powerful (with the California Teachers Association having been Newsom's top donor), to students' detriment. Though vaccinated against COVID-19, Kiley pledged to overturn vaccine and mask mandates Newsom implemented if he became governor.


=== United States Senate vacancies ===
In 2020, Kiley urged passage of his bill that would require the potential successor of then-candidate for vice president and Senator Kamala Harris to be elected by California's voters and not appointed by the governor; he reiterated that view during the 2021 gubernatorial recall campaign by pledging to allow voters to pick a replacement for Senator Dianne Feinstein if he became governor and her seat became vacant. Kiley later flagged a constitutional issue with Newsom's appointment of Alex Padilla to replace Harris and Padilla's expected service until January 2023, since the U.S. Constitution stipulates that such appointees serve "until the people fill the vacancies by election".
After lawmakers in the state assembly passed a bill to address the issue that would require voters to select two senators for the same seat—one to serve in the lame-duck session from November 2022 to January 2023 and another for January 2023 to January 2029—Kiley said Newsom should have called a special election to fill Harris's seat much earlier, and that the bill would solve the problem in "the most undemocratic way possible". Newsom eventually signed the bill, which meant California's voters had to vote simultaneously for both the lame-duck Senate seat and the next full Senate term.


== Personal life ==
Kiley married Chelsee Gardner on December 30, 2023. The ceremony took place at Pioneer Church in Auburn, California, the oldest church in Placer County. Chelsee and Kevin met at a community event in Rocklin, California, celebrating the Fourth of July. Kevin proposed to Chelsee in the summer of 2023 in the same park where they first met. The couple reside in Roseville. As of 2021, he resides in Rocklin, California.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 2022 ====

On December 29, 2021, Kiley announced he would run for the U.S. House in California's newly redrawn 3rd congressional district, which includes all or parts of Inyo, Sacramento, Mono, Alpine, El Dorado, Placer, Nevada, Sierra, Yuba, and Plumas counties.

Thomas Miller McClintock II ( mək-LIN-tok; born July 10, 1956) is an American politician serving as the U.S. representative for California's 5th congressional district since 2009 (known as the 4th congressional district until 2023). His district stretches from the Sacramento suburbs to the outer suburbs of Fresno; it includes Yosemite National Park. A member of the Republican Party, McClintock served as a California state assemblyman from 1982 to 1992 and from 1996 to 2000, when he became a California state senator, a position he held until 2008. He unsuccessfully ran for governor of California in the 2003 recall election and for lieutenant governor of California in the 2006 election.


== Early life, education and early political career ==
McClintock was born in White Plains, New York, and graduated in 1978 from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) with a degree in political science. At 23, he was elected chair of the Ventura County Republican Party, and served until 1981. He was chief of staff to State Senator Ed Davis from 1980 to 1982. From 1992 to 1994, he served as director of the Center for the California Taxpayer. He was director of the Claremont Institute's Golden State Center for Policy Studies from 1995 to 1996.


== California politics ==


=== California Assembly (1982–1992, 1996–2000) ===
In 1982, at age 26, McClintock ran for California's 36th State Assembly district, then based in Thousand Oaks, after redistricting. He defeated Democrat Harriet Kosmo Henson 56%–44%. He was reelected in 1984, defeating Tom Jolicoeur 72%–28%. In 1986, he was reelected to a third term, defeating Frank Nekimken 73%–25%. In 1988, he was reelected to a fourth term, defeating George Webb II 70%–29%. In 1990, he was reelected to a fifth term, defeating Ginny Connell 59%–36%.
After running for Congress in 1992 and for controller in 1994, McClintock ran for the Assembly again in 1996. He ran for California's 38th State Assembly district and defeated Democrat Jon Lauritzen 56%–40% to win his sixth Assembly term. In 1998, McClintock was reelected to a seventh term unopposed.
McClintock authored California's lethal injection use for California's death penalty law. He also opposed tax increases and supported spending cuts. He was a strong proponent of abolishing the car tax.


=== California Senate (2000–2008) ===
In 2000, McClintock retired from the California Assembly to run for California's 19th State Senate district. He ranked first in the March 7 open primary with 52% of the vote. In November, he defeated Democrat Daniel Gonzalez, 58%–42%. He was reelected in 2004, defeating Paul Joseph Graber, 61%–39%.
In 2008, McClintock voted against Proposition 2, which prohibits confining calves, pigs and hens in small cages in which they cannot extend their limbs. "Farm animals are food, not friends", he said in response to backlash to his vote. He also cited concern about increased grocery bills. In 2000, he was instrumental in proposing a two-thirds reduction in the vehicle license fee, or car tax. In 2003, he opposed then-Governor Gray Davis's attempt to rescind a rollback of a vehicle license fee. McClintock has also opposed deficit reduction efforts that would have increased taxes. He supported the Bureaucracy Reduction and Closure Commission and performance-based budgeting.


=== Other elections ===


==== 1994 controller election ====

McClintock ran for California State Controller after incumbent Gray Davis retired. He won the Republican primary, defeating John Morris, 61%–39%. In the general election, he lost to Kathleen Connell, former Special Assistant to Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley and Director of the L.A. Housing Authority, 48%–46%, with three other candidates receiving the other 6% of the vote.


==== 2002 controller election ====

McClintock ran for controller again in 2002, facing Democratic nominee Steve Westly, an eBay executive. Westly outspent him 5-to-1. McClintock's campaigns focused on increasing accountability for the state budget. The ads featured the character Angus McClintock, a fictional cousin and fellow Scottish American extolling McClintock's thriftiness and accountability in low-budget 15-second ads. He lost by a margin of just 0.2%, or 16,811 votes, to Westly, who won with 45.3% of the vote. Three other candidates received 9.5% of the vote.


==== 2003 gubernatorial recall election ====

In 2003, McClintock ran in the recall election against Davis. Republican and film actor Arnold Schwarzenegger won the election with 49% of the vote. Democratic Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante finished second with 31%. McClintock finished third with 14%. Together, Republicans Schwarzenegger and McClintock were supported by 5,363,778 Californians, or 62.1% of the vote. 132 other candidates received the remaining 6.4%.
McClintock performed the best in Stanislaus County, where he received 24% of the vote. He also cracked 20% or higher in several other counties: Mariposa (23%), Tuolumne (22%), Tehama (21%), Calaveras (20%), Madera (20%), Modoc (20%), Shasta (20%), San Joaquin (20%), and Ventura (20%).


==== 2006 lieutenant gubernatorial election ====

McClintock ran for lieutenant governor in 2006. He defeated Tony Farmer in the Republican primary, 94–6%. In the general election, he lost to Democratic State Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi, 49%–45%.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 1992 ====
After redistricting, McClintock retired from the Assembly to challenge Democratic U.S. Representative Anthony C. Beilenson in California's 24th congressional district. He won the nine-candidate Republican primary with a plurality of 34% of the vote, beating second-place finisher Sang Korman by 11 points. Beilenson defeated McClintock, 56–39%.


==== 2008 ====

On March 4, 2008, McClintock announced his candidacy for the U.S. House of Representatives in California's 4th congressional district, about 300 miles north of the district McClintock represented in the state Senate. The district's nine-term incumbent, John Doolittle, was retiring. McClintock was unable to vote for himself in either the primary or the general election. Although for most of the year he lived in Elk Grove, a suburb of Sacramento within the 3rd district at the time, his legal residence was in Thousand Oaks, within the borders of his state senate district. The California Constitution requires state senators to maintain their legal residence in the district they represent.
Upon McClintock's entry into the race, fellow Republicans Rico Oller and Eric Egland withdrew from the primary and endorsed him. He was also endorsed by the Republican Liberty Caucus, the Club for Growth, and U.S. Representative Ron Paul. McClintock faced former U.S. Representative Doug Ose, a moderate who represented the neighboring 3rd District from 1999 to 2005. Like McClintock, Ose lived outside the district and was painted as a carpetbagger and a liberal who had voted to raise taxes and who voted for earmarks. McClintock defeated Ose, 54–39%.
The Democratic nominee was retired Air Force Lt. Col. Charles D. (Charlie) Brown, who had run an unexpectedly strong race against Doolittle in 2006. In March 2008, Ose's campaign commercials criticized McClintock for receiving over $300,000 in per diem living expenses during his time in the state senate even though he lived in Elk Grove for most of the year. McClintock maintained that the payments were justified because his legal residence was in Thousand Oaks, in his district. He said, "Every legislator's [Sacramento area] residence is close to the Capitol. My residential costs up here are much greater than the average legislator because my family is here." Ose's campaign commercials argued McClintock did not own or rent a home in the 19th district, but claimed his mother's home in Thousand Oaks as his state senate district residence. These attacks prompted a response from McClintock's wife, Lori, who said McClintock stayed with his mother in order to care for her after she fell ill and after the death of her husband. McClintock ran ads attacking Brown's participation at a 2005 protest by Code Pink, a prominent antiwar group, and argued Brown supported gay marriage but not the troops in Iraq. He also portrayed Brown as a clone of Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
By November 23, McClintock led Brown by 1,566 votes (0.4% of the vote), 184,190 to 182,624. Subsequent returns expanded the margin slightly with the last returns coming in from El Dorado County shortly after Thanksgiving. On December 1, McClintock declared victory and Brown conceded on December 3. McClintock defeated Brown by a margin of 0.5%, or 1,800 votes. He prevailed by a 3,500-vote margin in Placer County, the district's largest county. Brown won three of the district's nine counties: Sierra (49.8%), Plumas (47.9%), and Nevada (42.3%). McClintock won mainly on the coattails from John McCain, who carried the 4th with 54% of the vote, his fifth-best total in the state.


==== 2010 ====

McClintock defeated Michael Babich in the Republican primary, Babich 78–22%. On November 2, he was reelected, defeating businessman Clint Curtis 61–31% and winning every county in the district.


==== 2012 ====

For his first two terms, McClintock represented a district covering the northeast corner of California, from the eastern suburbs of Sacramento to the Oregon border.
Redistricting after the 2010 census pushed the 4th well to the south. Only three counties remained from the old 4th: Nevada, Placer, and El Dorado. The redrawn district cut out the 4th's share of Sacramento County, including the part of Elk Grove that includes McClintock's home. Elk Grove is now entirely within the borders of the neighboring 7th District, represented by Democrat Ami Bera, making McClintock one of only a few members of Congress who live outside the district they represent. House members are constitutionally required only to live in the state they represent, but longstanding convention holds that they live in or reasonably close to their districts. McClintock said in 2016 that he intended to move his residence inside the redrawn 4th as soon as home prices rebounded enough for him to sell his Elk Grove home.
In 2012, California instituted its "top two" primary, in which candidates of all parties run against one another and the top two finishers, regardless of party, advance to the general election. McClintock and Democrat Jack Uppal were the only candidates in the "top two" primary, so the general election was a rematch. The reconfigured 4th was as strongly Republican as its predecessor, and McClintock was reelected to a third term, defeating Uppal 61%–39% in the general election. McClintock won all but two of the district's ten counties: Alpine (41%) and Nevada (37%).


==== 2014 ====

McClintock was reelected, finishing first in California's "top two" primary and defeating moderate Republican challenger National Guard Major Art Moore in the general election, 60%–40%.


==== 2016 ====

McClintock again finished first in the primary and defeated Democrat Robert W. Derlet, a physician, environmentalist and retired UC Davis professor, in the general election, 63%–37%.


==== 2018 ====

McClintock defeated Democratic challenger Jessica Morse in the general election, receiving 184,401 votes to her 156,253 (54.1% to 45.9%).


=== Tenure ===
During the 112th Congress McClintock was one of 40 members of the Republican Study Committee who frequently voted against Republican Party leadership and vocally expressed displeasure with House bills. In 2011, he voted against the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 due to a provision that would allow the government and the military to indefinitely detain American citizens and others without trial. McClintock's chief of staff, Igor Birman, was a candidate for Congress in California's 7th congressional district in 2014.
In 2009, McClintock signed a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity promising to vote against any global warming legislation that would raise taxes.
McClintock voted in favor of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. He voted against the first version of the bill, displeased with the removal of deductions related to medical expenses, student loan interest, and casualty loss. Those three items were addressed in the final version of the bill. McClintock said the bill would "restore American workers to an internationally competitive position." He expressed concern about the bill's impact on the budget deficit and anticipated that it would be addressed "by spending reforms this coming year."
In 2017, McClintock called for special prosecutor Robert Mueller to investigate President Donald Trump. McClintock felt that Trump's firing of James Comey justified a special prosecutor.
After Trump pulled 1,000 U.S. troops from Kurdish-held territory on the Syrian border south of Turkey in 2019, a bipartisan resolution passed the House, 354–60, that condemned him for abandoning those U.S. allies that would allow the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) to reestablish and regroup its forces, and allow the Turks to attack the Kurds. McClintock was one of the two members of California's congressional delegation to vote against it.
In 2020, McClintock was the sole House Republican to cosponsor the Ending Qualified Immunity Act, which was proposed in response to the murder of George Floyd and resultant widespread protests. The act was introduced by Justin Amash and Ayanna Pressley and cosponsored by 62 House Democrats in addition to McClintock. Because Amash was a registered Libertarian as of the act's introduction in June 2020, McClintock's support technically made the act the first tripartisan piece of federal legislation in modern U.S. history.
In the 118th Congress, McClintock voted against multiple motions to discipline certain Democrats in office, such as the first censure of Adam Schiff, the censure of Rashida Tlaib, and the impeachment of Alejandro Mayorkas. In each, he lambasted their actions but believed the motions were an erosion of the standards to which such motions should be held. Despite making a speech supporting holding Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress for the federal prosecution of Donald Trump, he would vote against holding him in contempt for refusing to release the audio files of the Hur interviews in the Joe Biden classified documents incident.
As of October 2021, McClintock had voted in line with Joe Biden's stated position 5% of the time.


=== Legislation ===
McClintock supported the Water Rights Protection Act, a bill that would prevent federal agencies from requiring certain entities to relinquish their water rights to the United States in order to use public lands. The bill was a reaction to the United States Forest Service's decision to pursue a "new regulation to demand that water rights be transferred to the federal government as a condition for obtaining permits needed to operate 121 ski resorts that cross over federal lands." McClintock supported the bill, saying that the Forest Service's regulation "illustrates an increasingly hostile attitude by this agency toward those who make productive use of our vast national forests, in this case by enhancing and attracting the tourism upon which our mountain communities depend."

== Political positions ==


=== 2020 presidential election ===
In December 2020, McClintock joined 125 other Republican members of Congress in signing an amicus brief in support of a lawsuit by the attorney general of the state of Texas that sought to overturn the certified results of the 2020 presidential election in four other U.S. states. The lawsuit was called a "seditious abuse of the judicial process" by the attorney general of Pennsylvania, and "simply madness" by 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a statement that called signing the amicus brief an act of "election subversion."
McClintock later became one of seven Republicans who did not support their colleagues' efforts to challenge the results of the election on January 6, 2021. These seven signed a letter that, while giving credence to election fraud allegations Trump made, said Congress did not have the authority to influence the election's outcome.
McClintock voted against impeaching Trump over his role in inciting the 2021 storming of the U.S. Capitol.


=== Animal rights ===
McClintock has said that "farm animals are food, not friends."


=== Cannabis ===
In 2015, McClintock introduced an amendment to limit the enforcement of federal law in states that have legalized cannabis. Known as the McClintock–Polis amendment, it failed by a 206–222 vote. It was reintroduced in 2019 as the Blumenauer–McClintock–Norton amendment and passed 267–165.
In 2016, McClintock endorsed California's Proposition 64, the Adult Use of Marijuana Act. He stated: "Our current laws have failed us, and have created a violent and criminal black market that actively and aggressively markets to young people. Legalization takes the criminal profit out of the equation, and allows us to regulate marijuana the same way we currently regulate alcohol."
In 2020, McClintock was one of five House Republicans to vote for the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act to legalize cannabis at the federal level. In 2021, he was one of four original cosponsors of a Republican-led legalization bill named the States Reform Act.


=== COVID-19 ===
During the COVID-19 pandemic, McClintock expressed the view that wearing face masks should not be mandatory, and while wearing a mask during congressional sessions, said, "this mask is useless". During the second impeachment of Donald Trump, McClintock wore a mask that read "This mask is as useless as our governor", referring to Governor Gavin Newsom.


=== Defense ===
In September 2021, McClintock was among 75 House Republicans to vote against the National Defense Authorization Act of 2022, which contains a provision that would require women to be drafted.


=== Environment ===
McClintock questions the role that human activity plays in climate change, arguing that the "climate has been changing for four and a half billion years."


=== Foreign policy ===
In 2019, McClintock was one of 60 representatives to vote against condemning Trump's withdrawal from Syria.
In 2020, McClintock voted against the National Defense Authorization Act of 2021, which would prevent the president from withdrawing soldiers from Afghanistan without congressional approval.
In June 2021, McClintock was one of 49 House Republicans to vote to repeal the AUMF against Iraq.
In July 2021, McClintock was one of five House Republicans to vote against a bill that allocates $2.1 billion for Afghan visas and Capitol Hill security.
In 2023, McClintock was among 47 Republicans to vote in favor of H.Con.Res. 21, which directed President Joe Biden to remove U.S. troops from Syria within 180 days.


=== Human and civil rights ===
McClintock opposes same-sex marriage. In 2008, he said, "calling a homosexual partnership a marriage doesn't make it one."

Vincent Karchi Fong (born October 24, 1979) is an American politician who has served as the U.S. representative for California's 20th congressional district since 2024. A member of the Republican Party, he previously represented the California's 32nd State Assembly district, encompassing parts of the Central Valley. Prior to his election to the Assembly in 2016, Fong served as district director to then-Minority Leader and Congressman Kevin McCarthy.


== Early life and education ==
Fong was born on October 24, 1979 in Bakersfield, California to Chinese immigrants. As a child, Vince Fong struggled with a stutter and described himself as "probably scared to death to speak in front of a group of people, let alone a class." He credited his teachers and mentors with helping him recognize his potential and overcome his fear of public speaking. He attended West High School and went on to earn an undergraduate degree in political science from the University of California, Los Angeles. He later obtained a master’s degree in public affairs from Princeton University.


== Early political career ==
Fong began his career as an aide to Congressman Bill Thomas, the then-chair of the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee. In this role, Fong focused on international trade policy, working to expand market access for U.S. farmers and small businesses. Fong then returned to Kern County to serve local residents, working nearly a decade as district director for Congressman Kevin McCarthy. He was actively involved in Kern County's community organizations and nonprofits, serving on the boards of Goodwill Industries of South Central California, the Jim Burke Education Foundation, and Honor Flight Kern County, supporting efforts to send WWII, Korean War, and Vietnam veterans to Washington, D.C., to visit their memorials. Additionally, he has held an elected position on the Kern County Republican Central Committee and is a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association.


== California State Assembly ==

In September 2016, Fong announced his candidacy for the California State Assembly to succeed Assemblymember Shannon Grove in the 34th district, who was term-limited. In the general election, Fong faced Perrin Swanlund, an 18-year-old who recently graduated from West High School, and won the election by a wide margin. He was re-elected in 2018, 2020, and 2022, with Fong being redistricted to the 32nd district in 2022. While serving in the Assembly, Fong authored several notable bills, including one aimed at reducing catalytic converter theft, another promoting wildfire prevention through controlled grazing, and a measure to provide firearm training materials in multiple languages. His legislative work has largely focused on enhancing public safety and fostering economic growth.
He resigned his Assembly seat on May 24, 2024, after winning the special election to the U.S. House of Representatives. Fong appeared on both ballots for the U.S. House and Assembly in the general election. For his Assembly seat, he endorsed Bakersfield City Councilor Ken Weir, who had secured a second-place spot in the primary via a write-in campaign, encouraging voters to select Weir over himself. Nevertheless, in the general election, Fong won over Weir.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==

On December 6, 2023, U.S. Representative Kevin McCarthy, having been removed as Speaker of the House, announced his resignation from Congress effective December 31. A special election was scheduled for March 19, 2024, with a runoff on May 21, 2024. Initially declining to run, Fong later announced his candidacy for the seat, despite already filing for re-election in the Assembly. California Secretary of State Shirley Weber deemed Fong ineligible to run in the congressional election due to his existing qualification for re-election, as state law prohibits candidates from running for two offices simultaneously. Fong sued the state, and Superior Court Judge Shelleyanne W. L. Chang ruled in his favor, permitting him to run. Weber appealed the decision, and Assemblymember Wendy Carrillo introduced a bill to prohibit dual candidacies. In January 2024, Weber petitioned a state appeals court to overturn the ruling, while Assemblywoman Gail Pellerin introduced a similar bill to prevent candidates from filing for multiple offices in the same election.
Fong advanced to the runoff in the special election against Tulare County Sheriff Mike Boudreaux, another Republican, and ultimately won with a 60%-39% margin. He was sworn in as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives by Speaker Mike Johnson on June 3, 2024. In the general election, Boudreaux withdrew and endorsed Fong, who went on to win re-election to a full term in the U.S. House of Representatives.

David Goncalves Valadao ( VAL-ə-DAY-oh; born April 14, 1977) is an American politician and dairy farmer serving as the U.S. representative for California's 22nd congressional district since 2023. His district comprises part of the San Joaquin Valley. A member of the Republican Party, Valadao first won election in 2012 in California's 21st congressional district. He lost in 2018 to TJ Cox, but was reelected in 2020.  Before his election to Congress, Valadao served one term in the California State Assembly, representing the 30th district from 2010 to 2012.
Valadao was one of ten Republicans who voted to impeach Donald Trump during Trump's second impeachment and one of two of those Republicans to be renominated and reelected, along with Dan Newhouse (WA-4).
Valadao defeated Democratic nominee California assemblyman Rudy Salas for the 22nd congressional district in a rematch in 2024.


== Early life and education ==
Valadao was born and raised in Hanford, California. His parents are Portuguese immigrants; his father grew up on the Azores Islands. In a 2013 interview, Valadao said his parents were initially registered Democrats but later switched to the Republican Party.
Valadao graduated from Hanford High School in 1995. From 1996 to 1998 he attended the College of the Sequoias in Visalia as a part-time student but did not graduate.


== Agriculture career and bankruptcy ==
Valadao's father established a dairy farm in Kings County, California in 1969. Valadao and his brother became partners in Valadao Dairy in 1992. He has been a member of the California Milk Advisory Board, Western States Dairy Trade Association, and Regional Leadership Council chairman for Land O' Lakes.
In March 2018, Valadao, a general partner of Triple V Dairy, was named in two lawsuits against the dairy for defaulting on almost $9 million in loans and failing to pay a supplier. In June 2018, a bank seized the dairy and sold it off to pay its debts. Valadao said, "Like so many family dairy farms across the country, burdensome government regulations made it impossible for the operation to remain open." After a lawsuit in 2019, Valadao agreed to pay $325,000 to former employees who claimed they had been denied breaks, minimum wage, and overtime pay. The settlement was not paid due to Valadao and Triple V Dairy filing for bankruptcy.


== California State Assembly ==

Valadao announced his candidacy for California's 30th State Assembly district after the 2010 retirement of Republican assemblyman Danny Gilmore. He defeated Stephanie Campbell in the Republican primary, 78%–22%. In the general election, he defeated Shafter Mayor Fran Florez, 61%–39%.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 2012 ====

In August 2011, Valadao announced that he would seek the Republican nomination for California's 21st congressional district. The district had previously been the 20th District, represented by four-term Democrat Jim Costa, but redistricting had shifted most of the district's share of Fresno to the new 16th District, and Costa sought reelection there.
In the June 5 open primary, he ranked first with 57% of the vote, ahead of Democrat John Hernandez – the head of the local Hispanic Chamber of Commerce – and Fresno City Councilman Blong Xiong. In the November 6 general election he defeated Hernandez, 58%–42%. A Wall Street Journal op-ed cited his victory in a district that had long been held by Democrats as a potential template for the GOP, while other analysts cited his opponent's "weakness as a candidate and a campaigner" as playing a major role.


==== 2014 ====

Valadao ran for reelection in November 2014. His challengers were Democrat Amanda Renteria, a former political aide to Dianne Feinstein and Debbie Stabenow, and John Hernandez, the Democratic nominee Valadao defeated in 2012. In the June 3 primary Valadao finished first once again with 63% of the vote, and received majorities of 60% or higher in every county except for Kern. In the November 4 general election, he was reelected with 58% of the vote.


==== 2016 ====

Valadao ran for reelection to a third term in 2016. His first challenger was Democrat Daniel Parra, the mayor pro tem of Fowler, California. Another Democratic challenger was Connie Perez, an accountant in Pasadena, California, who grew up in Tulare, but due to issues regarding her residency outside of the district, as well as an alleged recent change in party affiliation, Perez dropped out less than a month after announcing her candidacy. In January 2016 Emilio Huerta, son of United Farm Workers co-founder Dolores Huerta, announced his candidacy in the race as a Democrat. In the June 7 primary Valadao finished first with 54% of the vote and Huerta finished second with 24.2%. In the general election Valadao was reelected with 56.7% of the vote to Huerta's 43.3%.


==== 2018 ====

In 2018, Valadao was initially set to face Huerta again in a rematch, with Huerta announcing his bid in May 2017. However, in March 2018, Huerta suspended his campaign for lack of funds. After Huerta's withdrawal, engineer TJ Cox of Fresno announced that he would challenge Valadao. Cox had previously announced a challenge to Republican congressman Jeff Denham in the 10th district before switching to Valadao's seat.
Valadao declared victory on November 6 after the Associated Press initially called the race in his favor, but mail-in ballots gave Cox a very narrow lead. Cox officially won the race on November 28, and Valadao conceded on December 6. The final count showed that Cox won by 862 votes. It was one of the last U.S. House races to be decided in the 2018 cycle.


==== 2020 ====

Valadao ran for and won his former seat in 2020, defeating Cox in a rematch by 1,754 votes, 51% to 49%. This occurred even though Joe Biden carried the district by ten points.


==== 2022 ====

In June 2022, Valadao placed second in the open primary for California's redistricted 22nd congressional district, advancing to the November general election. Despite Valadao's vote to impeach President Trump, Trump did not involve himself in Valadao's primary and House minority leader Kevin McCarthy endorsed Valadao. According to the Los Angeles Times, the GOP declined to support a challenger because Valadao holds a seat in a Democratic-leaning district that "can't be won by any other Republican". Far-right Republican Chris Mathys ran in the primary. A Democratic campaign ad criticized Valadao for his impeachment vote, as part of a larger strategy of helping Mathys to make for higher chances of a Democratic candidate winning the seat.
Valadao faced state assemblyman Rudy Salas, a Democrat, in the November general election. Valadao defeated Salas in the general election, 52% to 48%. Valadao's victory made him one of just two House Republicans who supported impeaching Donald Trump to remain in Congress after the 2022 election, alongside Dan Newhouse of Washington.


==== 2024 ====

In the March 5, 2024 open primary, Valadao received approximately 33% of the vote to secure a place in the general election in November 2024. Rudy Salas received the next highest percentage of votes, with approximately 31%, and will again be Valadao's challenger. On November 12, 2024, the Associated Press declared Valadao the winner, winning approximately 53.5% of the vote.

== Political positions ==


=== Donald Trump ===
After Donald Trump became the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in May 2016, Valadao said he would support his candidacy. He rescinded his support in June 2016, declining to endorse Trump and saying he could not support a candidate who "denigrates people based on their ethnicity, religion, or disabilities."
In February 2017, Valadao voted against a resolution that would have directed the House to request ten years of Trump's tax returns, which would then have been reviewed by the House Ways and Means Committee in a closed session.
On January 13, 2021, Valadao was one of ten Republicans who voted for the second impeachment of Donald Trump for inciting the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. Valadao later said that despite misgivings about the process that the Democrats used to send the impeachment article to the floor, he felt he had to "go with my gut and vote my conscience" and vote to impeach. He called Trump a "driving force" behind the riots and concluded that his rhetoric at the rally preceding the riots was "un-American, abhorrent, and absolutely an impeachable offense."
On May 19, 2021, Valadao was one of 35 Republicans who joined all Democrats in voting to approve legislation to establish the January 6 commission meant to investigate the storming of the U.S. Capitol.


=== Environment ===
In response to President Barack Obama's repeated assertion that the 2011 California drought was caused by global warming, Valadao said that "climate change has nothing to do with the drought" and that Obama administration regulations had worsened the drought.


=== Foreign policy ===
In 2017, Valadao was blacklisted by Azerbaijan for taking part in a visit to Armenia and a disputed, breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh, which is populated and governed by ethnic Armenians.


=== Health care ===
Valadao favored repealing the Affordable Care Act. On May 4, 2017, he voted to repeal it and to pass the American Health Care Act (AHCA). He was one of three co-sponsors of a last-minute amendment that added $8 billion to fund high-risk pools for patients with pre-existing conditions. The revised version of AHCA allowed states to get waivers to allow insurers to charge individuals with preexisting conditions more if the individual has had a gap in insurance coverage.
In 2017, Valadao introduced H.R. 299, the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act, "to grant presumptive Agent Orange exposure status to U.S. service members who served in the territorial seas of Vietnam during the Vietnam War. This would enable eligible veterans to receive expedited consideration for Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits if they suffer from any of the diseases the U.S. Government has linked to Agent Orange." In August 2017, Valadao and Representative Joe Courtney sent a letter urging the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to ensure that Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans have access to medical care from the VA. That same year, Valadao and Representative Jeff Denham introduced the Assessing Critical Care Efforts to Strengthen Services Act. It would correct California's Medicaid reimbursement method to encourage physicians to operate in the Central Valley and ensure patient access to doctors and specialists. Also in 2017, Valadao and five other members of Congress introduced the Training the Next Generation of Primary Care Doctors Act of 2017, which would reauthorize the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education Program. It would expand existing programs at health centers and establish new teaching health centers.


=== LGBTQ+ rights ===
In 2016, Valadao voted for a measure that banned discrimination against LGBT employees by federal contractors. In 2015, Valadao did not join many other prominent California Republicans in signing a U.S. Supreme Court brief in favor of same-sex marriage.
On July 19, 2022, Valadao and 46 other Republican U.S. representatives voted for the Respect for Marriage Act, which would codify the right to same-sex marriage in federal law.


=== Immigration ===
Valadao supports comprehensive immigration reform.
In August 2014, he broke ranks with the Republican Party and voted against a bill that would have dismantled the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.
On February 23, 2017, Valadao called for a bipartisan solution to the U.S. immigration system. Later in 2017, he and nine other lawmakers wrote to Speaker of the House Paul Ryan asking for legislation to address DACA's future.
In June 2018, Valadao released a statement about the Department of Justice's "zero tolerance" policy, which involved separating children and parents at the Mexican border. "The substantial increase of minors at our southern border is both a humanitarian and national security crisis," he wrote. "While we must work towards a solution that reduces the occurrence of illegal border crossings, it is unacceptable to separate young children from their parents. This is exactly why passage of a compromise solution, such as that being discussed in Congress right now, is absolutely necessary."


=== Tax reform ===
In December 2017, Valadao voted in favor of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.


=== Free trade ===
Valadao has criticized the Trump administration's imposition of tariffs against Chinese steel and aluminum imports, which prompted China to impose retaliatory tariffs on a range of U.S. agriculture products. In May 2018, he sent a letter to United States trade representative Robert Lighthizer expressing concern over the tariffs' impact on the Central Valley's economy, writing, "Not only do the proposed tariffs fail to adequately remedy China's unfair practices, such tariffs seriously jeopardize our farmers' access to export markets, which accounts for roughly twenty percent of their production."


=== Welfare and poverty ===
In 2013, Valadao was one of 15 House Republicans to vote against a Republican-backed bill to make deep cuts in food stamp spending.


== Electoral history ==


== Honors and awards ==
In August 2014, the United States Chamber of Commerce awarded Valadao its Spirit of Enterprise Award. He won the same award again in 2016.


== Personal life ==
Valadao lives in Hanford with his wife, Terra, and their three children. He is fluent in Portuguese and Spanish.
During his first tenure in the House, Valadao consistently ranked as the poorest member of Congress by net worth, with over $17.5 million in debt in 2018, mainly loans to his family's dairy farm.

A Republican, he was previously a member of the California State Assembly representing the 33rd district. Before serving in the Assembly, Obernolte served on the city council and was the mayor of Big Bear Lake, California. He is the owner, president, and technical director of FarSight Studios, an American video game developer.


== Early life and education ==
Obernolte was born in Chicago, Illinois, and raised in Fresno, California. He graduated as valedictorian of Edison/Computech High School in 1988. In 1992, he obtained his Bachelor of Science degree in engineering and applied science from the California Institute of Technology and in 1997, he received his Master of Science in artificial intelligence from the University of California, Los Angeles. In 2020, he was awarded a Doctorate in Public Administration from the California Baptist University with a dissertation on "Managing Budgetary Conflict Between the Executive and Legislative Branches of Government".


== Career ==


=== Business ===
In 1990, Obernolte launched FarSight Studios, an independent developer and publisher of family-friendly video games. The company originally produced games for the Nintendo Entertainment System, and as of 2023 develops for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Oculus, Windows, macOS, iOS and Android. Notable games the studio has developed include Color a Dinosaur, Game Party, Hotel for Dogs, The Pinball Arcade, and the Sega Genesis version of Action 52. FarSight Studios claims Sony, Microsoft, Google, and Apple among its clients and employs 25 workers.


=== Politics ===
In 2005, Obernolte was elected to the Big Bear City Airport Board, where he served for five years. He then served as president of the board for three years and as vice president for one year.
In 2010, Obernolte was elected to Big Bear City Council, where he served as mayor. He also served on the Big Bear Lake Fire Protection Board, as director of the Mojave Desert and on the Mountain Integrated Waste JPA Board, the Mountain Area Regional Transit Authority Board, and the League of California Cities Desert-Mountain Division.
Obernolte served as state assemblyman for California's 33rd State Assembly district, which encompasses a wide expanse of the High Desert (areas of the Mojave Desert), from the eastern fringes of the Los Angeles metropolitan area to the Nevada and Arizona borders, from 2014 to 2020. He was elected to Congress in 2020 to replace retiring Paul Cook as representative for California's 8th congressional district, which includes Mono County, Inyo County, and the majority of land mass in San Bernardino County.


=== California State Assembly ===
In January 2016, Obernolte was elected to serve on the California Legislative Technology and Innovation Caucus, which is co-chaired by Assembly members Ian Calderon and Evan Low. He also sat on the following committees: Arts, Entertainment, Sports, Tourism, and Internet Media as vice chair; Budget as vice chair; Appropriations; Budget Subcommittee 6 on Budget Process, Oversight and Program Evaluation; Budget Subcommittee 6 on Budget Process, Oversight and Program Evaluation; Utilities and Commerce; Joint Committee on Arts; and Joint Legislative Budget.
In 2016, Obernolte expressed concern over Frontier Communications's acquisition of Verizon's voice, video, data, and FiOS network, saying that the takeover "negatively affected" his constituents through poor landline telephone service.
In 2016, Obernolte introduced Assembly Bill 2341, which would provide San Bernardino and other rural counties with additional judges to resolve backlogged court systems. The bill would have shifted seats from Santa Clara and Alameda counties to the rural counties including San Bernardino, but died in the Senate Appropriations Committee without a hearing.
In 2017, Obernolte opposed Xavier Becerra's nomination as California Attorney General.
Obernolte said that Governor Jerry Brown's $179.45 billion budget proposal was "responsible", but expressed a preference for fixing existing programs over creating new ones. He also stated an interest in funding job skills training, improving the state's Denti-Cal program, repairing infrastructure, and working on the housing crisis. Obernolte pushed for lawmakers to limit long-term funding commitments and said the budget proposal did nothing to address the "state's out-of-control pension debts and retiree health care liabilities."
Obernolte co-authored Assembly Bill 1103, which would have allowed California bicyclists to roll through stop signs if it was safe to do so (the "Idaho stop"). The bill died in committee.
Obernolte authored Assembly Bill 1642, which would extend the deadlines to either pay the fire tax, which is a state fire prevention fee, or file a petition for redetermination from 30 days to 60 days. In July 2017, the fire fee was suspended as part of Assembly Bill 398. Obernolte opposed raising fire insurance costs, which is calculated by factors in the risk of wildfire, fuels, slope and road access for emergency vehicles.
Obernolte opposed increases in the minimum wage.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==

=== Tenure ===
On January 6, 2021, Obernolte voted not to count Arizona's and Pennsylvania's electoral votes in the 2020 United States presidential election, citing unilateral changes to election law made in those states by the judiciary or executive branch rather than the state legislature. He also voted against impeaching Trump for inciting his supporters to attack the Capitol on January 6. Obernolte voted against the creation of the January 6 commission.
Obernolte's first pieces of legislation to pass the House concerned the enabling of technological advancement. His Fellowship and Traineeship for Early Career AI Researchers Act and Next Generation Computing Research and Development Act were included in the bipartisan H.R. 2225, the National Science Foundation (NSF) For the Future Act, and H.R. 3593, the Department of Energy Science for the Future Act respectively. His first standalone legislation, H.R. 3533, passed the House in September 2021. It establishes occupational series for federal positions in software development, software engineering, data science, and data management.
In February 2021, Obernolte voted against the resolution that stripped Marjorie Taylor Greene of her committee assignments for her incendiary and violent statements.

In March 2021, he voted against the American Rescue Plan Act.

He said, "As an ardent advocate for limited government, I do not feel that government should be empowered to dictate the terms of a marriage."

Darrell Edward Issa ( EYESS-ə; born November 1, 1953) is an American businessman and politician serving as the U.S. representative for California's 48th congressional district. He represented the 50th congressional district from 2021 to 2023. A member of the Republican Party, he previously served in the United States House of Representatives from 2001 to 2019, representing two districts primarily covering North County in the San Diego area, first the 48th district for one term and then the 49th district for eight terms. From January 2011 to January 2015, he chaired the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.
Issa was CEO of Directed Electronics, which he co-founded in 1982. It is one of the largest makers of automobile aftermarket security and convenience products in the United States. With a net worth of approximately $460 million, Issa is the wealthiest serving member of Congress as of 2023.
On January 10, 2018, Issa announced that he would not seek reelection to the House. Democrat Mike Levin was elected on November 6, 2018, to become the district's next representative. On September 19, 2018, President Donald Trump nominated Issa to be director of the United States Trade and Development Agency.
On September 26, 2019, Issa announced that he was running for California's 50th congressional district in the 2020 election. He placed second in the March top-two primary, advancing to face Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar in the November general election. Issa defeated Campa-Najjar.


== Early life, education, and military service ==
The second of six children, Issa was born in Cleveland, Ohio, the son of Martha (née Bielfelt) and William Issa, who sold trucks and ground valves. His father was the son of Lebanese Christian immigrants, and a member of the Maronite Catholic faith. His mother is of German and Bohemian (Czech) descent and a Latter-day Saint.
During his childhood, the large family moved to a three-bedroom house in the predominantly Jewish suburb of Cleveland Heights. Many of Issa's friends were Jewish, and he reportedly worked for a rabbi at one point. He became very familiar with Jewish culture.
In 1970, on his 17th birthday, Issa dropped out of high school and enlisted in the Army. He became an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) technician assigned to the 145th Ordnance Detachment. Trained to defuse bombs, Issa has said that his unit provided security for President Richard Nixon, sweeping stadiums for bombs before games in the 1971 World Series. A May 1998 investigation by Lance Williams of the San Francisco Examiner found that Nixon had not attended any 1971 World Series games, but that Issa's unit did perform security sweeps during the series. First Lady Pat Nixon was present at Game 2 of the series, where she threw the first pitch. After the series, Issa was transferred to a supply depot, a result of receiving poor ratings.
Issa received a hardship discharge from the Army in 1972 after his father suffered a heart attack. After that, he earned a General Educational Development (GED) certificate.
Twice that year, Issa was arrested. In the first incident, a grand jury indicted him for theft of a Maserati, in a complicated scheme with his brother William, but prosecutors dropped the charge. In the second incident, he was stopped for driving the wrong way on a one-way street, and a police officer noticed a firearm in his car's glove compartment; Issa was charged with carrying a concealed weapon. He pleaded guilty to possession of an unregistered firearm and was sentenced to six months' probation and a small fine. Issa has said he believes the record has since been expunged.
Issa majored in business administration at Siena Heights University, a small Roman Catholic college in Adrian, Michigan, completing his degree at the Stark campus of Kent State University. While at Kent State, he enrolled in the Reserve Officer Training Corps; at graduation he was commissioned as a second lieutenant.
Issa served in the Army Reserve from 1976 to 1980, and was promoted to captain. From September 9–26, 1980, Issa served on active duty while training with the 1/77th Armor Battalion as an Assistant S-1. His evaluation report, by then-Lt. Col. Wesley Clark, read, "This officer's performance far exceeded that of any other reserve officer who has worked in the battalion" and "Promote ahead of contemporaries. Unlimited potential."
Shortly before his discharge from the Army in 1980, Issa was again indicted for grand theft auto. The prosecution dropped the case in August 1980. In 1981, Issa was in a car crash. The other motorist sued him for $20,000; they eventually settled out of court for an undisclosed amount.


== Business career ==


=== Quantum/Steal Stopper ===
After leaving the military, Issa and his second wife, Kathy Stanton, returned to the Cleveland area. According to Issa, he and his wife pooled their savings, sold their cars (a 1976 Mercedes and a 1967 VW Beetle) and a BMW motorcycle, and borrowed $50,000 from family members to invest in Quantum Enterprises, an electronics manufacturer run by a friend from Cleveland Heights. It assembled bug zappers, CB radio parts, and other consumer products for other companies. One of those clients, car alarm manufacturer Steal Stopper, became the path to Issa's fortune. It was struggling badly, and he took control of it by foreclosing a $60,000 loan he had made to it when its founder, Joey Adkins, missed a payment. Adkins remained as an employee.
Issa soon turned Steal Stopper around, to the point that it was supplying Ford with thousands of car alarms and negotiating a similar deal with Toyota. Early in the morning of September 7, 1982, Quantum and Steal Stopper's offices and factory in the Cleveland suburb of Maple Heights caught fire. The fire took three hours to put out. The buildings and almost all the inventory within were destroyed. An investigation of the fire noted "suspicious burn patterns" with fires starting in two places aided by an accelerant such as gasoline.
Adkins said Issa had appeared to prepare for a fire by increasing the fire insurance policy by 462% three weeks earlier, and by removing computer equipment containing accounting and customer information. St. Paul Insurance, suspicious of arson and insurance fraud, initially paid only $25,000, according to Issa.


=== Directed Electronics ===

Steal Stopper soon returned a profit again. As car theft rose in the U.S. during the 1980s, so did the demand for security devices. Rolls-Royce, BMW, and General Motors joined Ford and Toyota as customers of Steal Stopper. In 1985, Issa sold the company to a California-based maker of home alarms, and moved to the San Diego suburb of Vista, to work for the company.
Shortly afterward, Issa left to start Directed Electronics, Inc. (DEI). He has continued to live in Vista. Issa used his knowledge of the weaknesses in automotive security to develop effective theft deterrents. Using sensors that, when armed, would detect motion and pressure on the car's body, his device made loud noise to draw attention to a would-be car thief, such as the car's horn honking or a speaker playing a recording with Issa's voice saying: "Protected by Viper. Stand back" and "Please step away from the car", warnings for DEI's signature product, the Viper car alarm. Sales grew from $1 million in the company's first year to $14 million by 1989.


=== Greene Properties ===
Issa is partner in 17 limited partnerships and limited liability companies (LLCs) that own commercial properties across North San Diego County. He is CEO of Greene Properties, Inc., a privately held real estate investment company with commercial real estate holdings in San Diego North County. Headquartered in Vista, it manages three commercial office buildings in Carlsbad with a total of 26,354 square feet. Employees include his wife and son William "Will" Issa as assistant property manager. The office is in the same building as Issa's former congressional office, near their house of the last 20 years.


== Early political career ==


=== Activism ===
Active in consumer-electronics trade organizations, Issa became more directly involved in politics. He went to Washington, D.C. to lobby Congress and later became one of California's biggest individual campaign contributors to Republican candidates. In 1996, he chaired the successful campaign to pass California Proposition 209, a ballot initiative that prohibited Californian public institutions from considering race, sex, or ethnicity in public employment, public contracting, or public education. He was instrumental in persuading the national Republican Party to hold its 1996 convention in San Diego.


=== 1998 U.S. Senate election ===

Issa's first campaign for elected office was in 1998, when he sought the Republican nomination for United States Senate to face incumbent Democrat Barbara Boxer. He spent $10 million of his own money in the primary, running against California State Treasurer Matt Fong, Congressman Frank Riggs, and three others. Fong's campaign raised $3 million from contributions and complained that Issa's wealth made for an uneven playing field (Issa received only $400,000 in contributions from others). An Issa spokesman countered that the money was needed to compensate for Fong's statewide name recognition. Issa lost to Fong, 45% to 40%; Riggs got 10% of the vote. A San Francisco exit poll suggested large numbers of Asian Americans, who typically vote in the Democratic primary, had crossed party lines to strategically vote for Fong.

=== Elections ===


==== 2000 ====

Nine-term incumbent Republican U.S. Congressman Ron Packard decided not to run for reelection in 2000, in California's 48th congressional district. Issa ran for the seat, capitalizing on his name recognition from the 1998 Senate race. The district was primarily based in northern San Diego County, but had small portions in Riverside and Orange counties. Issa finished first in the all-party primary with 35% of the vote, winning a plurality in all three counties; Republican state senator Bill Morrow was second, with 24% of the votes. Issa won the November general election, defeating Democratic nominee Peter Kouvelis 61%–28%.


==== 2002 ====

After redistricting, Issa's district was renumbered the 49th and lost its share of Orange County. Like its predecessor, the district was still overwhelmingly Republican; it had a Cook Partisan Voting Index (PVI) of R+10. No Democrat filed against Issa that year. He was reelected, defeating Libertarian nominee Karl Dietrich, 77%–22%.


==== 2004 ====

A write-in candidate from the 2002 election, Mike Byron, became the Democratic challenger in 2004. Issa was reelected to a third term, defeating Byron 63%–35%.


==== 2006 ====

Issa was reelected to a fourth term, defeating Democratic nominee Jeeni Criscenzo, 63%–33%. He was one of four Middle Eastern American members in that Congress. He has said that he identified primarily as Lebanese, not as pan-Arab.


==== 2008 ====

Issa was reelected to a fifth term, defeating Democratic nominee Robert Hamilton, 58%–37%. The 21-point margin of victory was the second smallest in Issa's career. He carried San Diego with 60% of the vote and Riverside with 57% of the vote.


==== 2010 ====

Issa was reelected to a sixth term, defeating Democratic nominee Howard Katz, 63%–31%.


==== 2012 ====

After the 2010 census, Issa's district was renumbered the 49th and made significantly more compact. It lost its share of Riverside County, along with most of its share of San Diego County. It gained a small portion of southern Orange County, including San Clemente, San Juan Capistrano, Dana Point, and part of Laguna Niguel. The district was more competitive on paper than its predecessor. The old 49th had a PVI of R+10, while the new 49th has a PVI of R+4.
Issa was reelected to a seventh term, defeating Democratic nominee Jerry Tetalman, 58%–42%. The 16-point margin of victory was the smallest in Issa's political career. Issa carried the San Diego portion of his district with 55% of the vote and the Orange County part with 66%.


==== 2014 ====

The June open primary was contested by Issa and two Democrats: Dave Peiser and Noboru Isaga. The top two vote-getters, Issa (62%) and Peiser (28%), advanced to the general election. Issa was elected to an eighth term, 60% to 40%.


==== 2016 ====

In the June open primary, Issa received 51% of the vote to 46% for Democrat Doug Applegate, a retired Marine colonel. Issa and Applegate advanced to the general election in November. In October, Applegate and Issa were ranked by the Cook Political Report as equally likely to win.
Issa sent out a campaign mailer that featured a photograph of President Barack Obama signing a law. The mailer said that Issa was "very pleased" that Obama signed the Sexual Assault Survivors' Rights Act, which Issa had co-sponsored.
Unusually, President Obama responded to this late campaign mailer by saying that Issa's "primary contribution to the U.S. Congress has been to obstruct and to waste taxpayer dollars on trumped up investigations that have led nowhere." Obama said that, because of fading support for Donald Trump, Issa was promoting his cooperation with the president although he had previously accused Obama of corruption.
Issa said, "I've worked with the administration on good legislation where it was possible, called out wrongdoing wherever I saw it and will continue to do so."
On November 23, 2016, Issa held a 3,234-vote lead with approximately 6,000 ballots still uncounted. He declared victory, but Applegate had not conceded. The Associated Press finally declared Issa the winner on November 28, citing a small but convincing lead with only a few votes left to count.


==== 2018 ====

Multiple Democrats, including Applegate and environmental attorney Mike Levin, launched campaigns for California's 49th district seat. Given the close margin in 2016, the election was expected to be highly competitive. For months, Issa's Vista office was the site of weekly protests. Hundreds of people gathered to protest against Trump and his agenda and actions. At a May rally, 800 people showed up to protest the House vote to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). On January 10, 2018, Issa announced that he would not run for reelection. Democrat Mike Levin won the seat.


==== 2020 ====

On September 26, 2019, Issa announced that he was running for California's 50th congressional district in the 2020 election. The incumbent at that time was fellow Republican Duncan D. Hunter, who was then under indictment. In December 2019, Hunter pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations and resigned from Congress effective January 13, 2020, leaving the seat vacant.
In redistricting, the 50th district had absorbed much of Issa's former base in the more Republican inland portion of San Diego County. Issa placed second in the March 3, 2020, blanket primary and beat Democratic challenger Ammar Campa-Najjar by nearly 30,000 votes in the general election. Issa said he could switch districts because he owns his mother's home in Bonsall. He has long lived in Vista, where he has raised his family.


=== Tenure ===


==== Oversight committee ====
After the 2010 elections, Issa became chair of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. He was a vocal advocate for investigations into the Obama administration, including the Troubled Assets Relief Program, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, corruption in Afghanistan, WikiLeaks, and the Food and Drug Administration, among other topics. In 2010 he told the press that he wanted the committee to hold investigative hearings "seven hearings a week, times 40 weeks."
In February 2011, the Watchdog Institute, a nonprofit investigative reporting center based at San Diego State University, published an investigation alleging that as leader of the committee, Issa built a team that included staff members with close connections to industries that could benefit from his investigations.
On February 16, 2012, the committee held a hearing on the Department of Health and Human Services's regulation requiring insurance plans to cover birth control, which Issa believed to be a violation of the religious freedom of people who oppose the use of birth control. Democratic members submitted attorney and activist Sandra Fluke as a witness for promoting women's health, but Issa did not permit her to testify, saying her name was submitted too late, a claim Democrats challenged.


==== Legislation ====
In 2013 Issa introduced the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2013 (H.R. 2061; 113th Congress). H.R. 2061 aimed to make information on federal expenditures more easily available, accessible, and transparent. President Obama signed the bill into law on May 9, 2014.
Issa introduced the FOIA Oversight and Implementation Act of 2014 (H.R. 1211; 113th Congress) on March 15, 2013, a bill to amend the Freedom of Information Act in order to make it easier and faster to request and receive information. The bill would have required the Office of Management and Budget to create a single FOIA website for people to use to make FOIA requests and check on the status of their request. It would also have created a Chief FOIA Officers Council charged with reviewing compliance and recommending improvements, and required the federal agency to release the information it disclosed to the person who requested it publicly afterward.
Issa argued in favor of the bill because it "shifts the burden of proof from the public requestor seeking information about a government agency...to the government being open and transparent unless it has a good reason to withhold." The bill passed the House unanimously on February 25, 2014, but a nearly identical Senate bill failed when it was tabled by House Speaker John Boehner.
Issa introduced the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (H.R. 1232; 113th Congress) on March 18, 2013, to make changes and reforms to the framework that manages how the federal government buys new technology. One of the requirements would be that the government develop a streamlined plan for its acquisitions. The bill would increase the power of federal agencies' chief information officers (CIO) so that they could be more effective.
Each agency would also be reduced to having only one CIO, who would be responsible for the success and failure of the agency's IT projects. The bill would also require the federal government to make use of private sector best practices. The bill was intended to reduce IT procurement-related waste. It passed the House in a voice vote on February 25, 2014. In December 2014 it passed as a section of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015. Issa also introduced and co-sponsored The Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (Pub.L. 113–283, S. 2521; commonly referred to as FISMA Reform), which Obama signed into law on December 18, 2014.
On May 7, 2014, Issa introduced a simple resolution in the House (which passed 231 - 187): Recommending that the House of Representatives find Lois G. Lerner, former Director, Exempt Organizations, Internal Revenue Service, in contempt of Congress for refusal to comply with a subpoena duly issued by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. The resolution holds Lois Lerner, one of the central Internal Revenue Service officials involved in the 2013 IRS scandal, in contempt of Congress for her refusal to testify about the scandal before Issa's committee in response to a subpoena.
In July 2017, Issa introduced the CLASSICS Act to Congress in a bipartisan effort to empower artists by collecting royalties for the preceding three-year period and also by ensuring their creative rights remain in force for pre-1972 recordings just as newer artists are guaranteed by current legislation. Issa has been a consistent cosponsor of the Fair Play Fair Pay Act as well; granting radio performance rights for musicians and record producers.


=== Bombing plot ===
In 2001, Issa's San Clemente district office was targeted in an aborted bombing plot. Jewish Defense League leader Irving Rubin was arrested along with Earl Krugel in connection with the plot, which reportedly had focused on other targets before shifting to Issa's office. Issa speculated that the cause of the incident may have been a column written by political commentator Debbie Schlussel in which she charged that Issa sympathized with Hezbollah despite its being listed by the U.S. government as a terrorist organization, charges he denied.


=== Ethics complaints and 2010 award ===
In September 2011, a liberal advocacy and lobbying group, American Family Voices, filed a complaint with the Office of Congressional Ethics against Issa, alleging he had repeatedly used his position of authority on the Oversight Committee to improperly intervene in dealings with Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, and DEI Holdings, all of which Issa is associated with in some way. Issa's office rejected the allegations.
The year before, the Project on Government Oversight, a government watchdog group, gave Issa its Good Government Award for his contributions to government oversight and transparency. These included publicizing documents produced by the New York Federal Reserve Bank in response to a congressional subpoena, publicly exposing the NYFR's secret "back-door bailout" of AIG's counterparties, and cofounding a Transparency Caucus dedicated to "promoting a more open and accountable government through education, legislation, and oversight." In 2012 Issa featured in TechCrunch's list of "The 20 Most Innovative People in Democracy."
In late February 2021, Issa and a dozen other Republican House members skipped votes and enlisted others to vote for them, citing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, while actually attending the Conservative Political Action Conference, which was held at the same time as their slated absences. In response, the Campaign for Accountability, an ethics watchdog group, filed a complaint with the House Committee on Ethics and requested an investigation into Issa and the other lawmakers.


=== Committee assignments ===
For the 118th Congress:

Committee on Foreign Affairs
Subcommittee on Europe
Subcommittee on Oversight and Accountability
Committee on Science, Space, and Technology
Subcommittee on Research and Technology
Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics
Committee on the Judiciary

Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government


=== Caucus memberships ===
Congressional Constitution Caucus
Congressional NextGen 9-1-1 Caucus
Climate Solutions Caucus
Freedom Caucus
Congressional Armenian Caucus
Republican Study Committee


== Political positions ==
Issa voted with the majority of House Republicans 95% of the time during the 111th Congress.


=== Abortion ===
As of 2020, Issa has a A+ rating from the Susan B. Anthony List for his abortion-related voting record. He supported the overturning of Roe v. Wade, calling the day the decision was made a "great day for the cause and principle of life".


=== 9/11 first responders ===
In April 2008, the Daily News reported that Issa questioned federal expenditures pertaining to disability-compensation claims from 9/11 first responders. He was criticized for making comments that the federal government "'just threw' buckets of cash at New York for an attack 'that had no dirty bomb in it, it had no chemical munitions in it'" and asking "why the firefighters who went there and everybody in the city of New York needs to come to the federal government for the dollars versus this being primarily a state consideration." In September 2009, Issa's office released a statement indicating that his comments had been misrepresented and that the questions he asked concerned the then still unpassed bill H.R. 3543, which, according to the statement, "would give U.S. taxpayer dollars to those who did not suffer physical injury and did not work at or around Ground Zero."


=== 2003 California gubernatorial recall election ===
Issa came to national prominence in 2003 when he contributed more than $1.6 million to help fund a signature-gathering drive for the petition to recall California Governor Gray Davis. At the time he made the contribution, it was widely believed that Issa intended to run to replace Davis. But after fellow Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger entered the race two days before the filing deadline, Issa announced that he would not run. He later said his mission had been accomplished with Davis's recall and that he wanted to continue to represent his district in Congress and work toward Middle East peace. At one point in the campaign he suggested people should vote against recalling Davis unless one of the two leading Republican contenders dropped out, concerned that Schwarzenegger and fellow Republican Tom McClintock would split votes, resulting in Democratic lieutenant governor Cruz Bustamante's election. Issa endorsed Schwarzenegger, who won the governorship when Davis was recalled.


=== Civil rights ===
Issa voted against an amendment, which ultimately failed narrowly, that stated that religious corporations, associations and institutions that receive federal contracts cannot be discriminated against on the basis of religion. Democrats warn that such a provision could potentially allow discrimination against the LGBT community in the name of religious freedom.


=== Donald Trump ===
Issa attracted attention for his close relationship with and strong support for Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential election. He endorsed Trump in March 2016. When the Donald Trump and Billy Bush recording surfaced, Issa condemned Trump's remarks but did not rescind his endorsement.
In early February 2017, Issa expressed his support for a special prosecutor to look into Trump's ties to Russia. On February 27, he walked back his previous comments. Issa supported Trump's dismissal of FBI Director James Comey, saying "Comey had lost my confidence long ago."
Issa said he believed Russia meddled with the 2016 election. He supported Trump's firing of Comey (who was leading the investigation into the meddling) and that said the U.S. should focus on other issues. As of May 2017, Issa had voted in line with Trump's positions 100% of the time; by October 2018, that number had fallen to 93.3%.
On January 7, 2021, after Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol building, Issa voted to reject the certification of Pennsylvania's electoral votes in the 2020 presidential election. He voted against impeaching Trump on an articles of impeachment for "incitement of insurrection" in the aftermath of the attack on the Capitol. In May 2021, Issa voted against the creation of an independent commission to investigate the January 6 attack.


=== Drug policy ===
As of 2022, marijuana legalization advocacy group NORML gave Issa an F rating for his cannabis-related voting record.


=== Environment ===
Before the 2010 election, Issa pledged that, if elected, he would probe "Climategate", which refers to the hacked Climatic Research Unit emails that climate change denialists falsely asserted showed scientific misconduct and fraud by climate scientists. He called Obama's unwillingness to investigate Climategate "unconscionable" and an abdication of responsibility.


=== Foreign and defense policy ===
In 2001, Issa voted for the authorization of the PATRIOT Act and the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. He voted to reauthorize the Patriot Act in 2005 after successfully amending it to require judicial notification, reporting requirements and facts justifying the use of roving surveillance at new facilities or places.
Issa is one of several Lebanese-Americans in Congress. He had a significant role in U.S. peace initiatives in the Middle East. He traveled to Lebanon and Syria in an effort to negotiate the end of the Syrian occupation of Lebanon. In 2003, he appeared at a Washington rally by Iranian groups protesting against the Islamist government in Iran.
In March 2015, Issa supported the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen, saying, "We must make it clear that we will support our allies and punish our enemies through steadfast resolve and decisive action."
In June 2021, Issa was one of 49 House Republicans to vote to repeal the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 (AUMF) against Iraq.


=== Health care ===
Issa favors repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), and voted in support of the budget resolution to repeal it in January 2017.
On May 4, 2017, Issa voted to repeal Obamacare and pass the American Health Care Act.
The organization San Diego Indivisible protested outside Issa's office weekly. After Issa voted for the AHCA, about 800 people from the organization protested, on the grounds that a significant portion of his voters rely on the ACA. The group was also unhappy about a photo in which Issa stood "front and center" in tribute to Republicans' success in passing the AHCA.
Instead of coming back to California to meet the protesters, Issa flew to an event in Florida to raise money, though he said he would meet with them later.
The next Friday, over 100 people protested his desire to defund Planned Parenthood.
An organization called Save My Care spent $500,000 to release a series of attack ads against 24 House members who voted for the AHCA, including one about Issa.


=== Israel ===
In 2023, he voted for a resolution stating support for Israel against the war launched by Hamas.


=== LGBT rights ===
On July 19, 2022, Issa and 46 other Republican Representatives voted for the Respect for Marriage Act, which would codify the right to same-sex marriage in federal law.


=== Science ===
Issa supports embryonic stem cell research and has voted to allow it.
He co-sponsored both the 2008 and 2009 versions of the Fair Copyright in Research Works Act and sponsored the Research Works Act (H.R. 3699) introduced in 2011, all of which aim at a reversal of the NIH's Public Access Policy, which mandates open access to NIH-funded research.


=== Tax reform ===
Issa voted against the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. He was one of two California Republicans to vote against the bill, alongside Dana Rohrabacher. Issa expressed concern that "many" of his constituents would face increased taxes under the proposal and that "Californians have entrusted me to fight for them. I will not make the incredible tax burden they already endure even worse."


=== Technology ===
Issa opposed the Stop Online Piracy Act because of the amount of discretion it would give the Department of Justice.


=== Veterans ===
The PACT ACT which expanded VA benefits to veterans exposed to toxic chemicals during their military service, received a "nay" from Issa. Regarding cannabis, despite lobbying from VSOs such as the DAV, Issa also voted against the 2022 MORE Act.


== Personal life ==
In the 1970s, Issa married his high school sweetheart, Marcia Enyart. They eventually divorced. After he left the military, Issa married Kathy Stanton. The two met while neighbors, when Stanton locked her keys inside her apartment and Issa climbed up the balcony to get into her apartment. They were married in 1980 and had one son. In July 2018, he filed for divorce from Kathy, and their divorce became final in March 2021.

Jeffrey George Crank (born January 28, 1967) is an American politician and radio show host. He is the representative for Colorado's 5th congressional district to the United States House of Representatives.


== Early life, education, and career ==

Crank was born in Pueblo, Colorado in 1967 and earned a Bachelor of Arts in political science from Colorado State University. He hosted a talk radio show on KVOR-AM. From 1991 to 1998, he worked as a congressional staffer for Representative Joel Hefley, being a Legislative Assistant until being promoted as administrative director in April 1995. After working for Congressman Hefley, he became Vice President of the Colorado Springs Chamber of Commerce in May 1998 and was later promoted to Senior Vice President in October 2001.

John Henry Rutherford (; born September 2, 1952) is an American politician and former police officer serving as the U.S. representative from Florida's 5th congressional district since 2017. His district encompasses southeast Jacksonville and all of St. Johns County.
Rutherford was an officer with the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office for four decades, before being elected Duval County sheriff in 2003; he remained in that post until 2015. In 2016, he ran for the House of Representatives in what was at the time Florida's 4th congressional district. He won the election and was reelected in 2018, 2020, and 2022. Rutherford is a Republican.


== Early life and education ==
John Rutherford was born in Omaha, Nebraska, in 1952. His father was in the U.S. Navy and was serving in Korea at the time of his son's birth. In the 1950s, Rutherford's family moved to Jacksonville, Florida. He graduated from Nathan Bedford Forest High School in 1970. He surfed in his free time. In 1972, he earned his Associate of Science in criminology from Florida State College at Jacksonville, formerly Florida Junior College, followed by his Bachelor of Science in criminology from Florida State University in 1974.


== Jacksonville Sheriff's Office ==

Rutherford spent 41 years at the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office, first as a sheriff's deputy and for the final 12 years as the elected sheriff. He joined the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office in 1974 as a patrolman. He was promoted to sergeant in 1980 and ultimately rose to the rank of captain. At various points, he commanded the Arson and Burglary divisions, led the Police Academy, and led patrol units on the Southside. He was also Chief of Services, Traffic and Special Operations, and Chief of Patrol. He was appointed director of corrections in 1995 by then-Sheriff Nat Glover. In that role, he was responsible for overseeing the jail.
Rutherford ran for Jacksonville Sheriff in 2003. A candidate for the Jacksonville City Council filed a complaint against Rutherford in February, alleging violations of the Federal Hatch Act of 1939, which prohibits employees working for federally funded agencies from running for office in partisan elections. Rutherford said that a lawyer had told him there was no conflict, but he retired in March 2003 anyway, in order to remove any doubt, with 28 years of service.
The Florida Times-Union reported in 2015, "Supporters and even those who criticize him say Rutherford has been steadfast and unwavering in his faith and his convictions as a lawman, a trait some say has brought success while others say is to his detriment." Rutherford's tenure was marked by rises and falls in crime: from 2002 to 2005, Jacksonville suffered an increase in murder and other violent crime; murders briefly declined in 2005, but then rose again each year until 2008, when another decline began. In 2007, the Florida Times-Union endorsed Rutherford for reelection—saying that he was generally moving his department "in a positive direction"—but criticized the pace and inadequacies of key initiatives, such as reducing the murder rate, tackling illegal guns, and initiating a management audit. Overall, the Jacksonville crime rate was about the same at the beginning and end of Rutherford's tenure.
As sheriff, Rutherford was a staunch critic of State Attorney Harry Shorstein and an ally of his successor, Angela Corey. He was credited with improving the sheriff's department's capacities to deal with mental health matters and his oversight of a prisoner reentry program, but was criticized for enduring tensions and a lack of trust between the local African American community and police, as well as a high number of police shootings by the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office. According to a Wall Street Journal report, Jacksonville had the ninth-highest rate of justifiable homicides among the U.S.'s 105 largest police department efforts between 2007 and 2012.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 2016 ====

After initially considering a run for the state House, Rutherford announced his candidacy for Florida's 4th congressional district on April 15, 2016, for the open seat created by the retirement of the Republican incumbent, Ander Crenshaw. Originally he announced he would run for Florida's 6th congressional district in 2015. Because the 4th district is a Republican safe seat, Rutherford was heavily favored in each election.
In the August 2016 Republican primary, Rutherford faced State Representative Lake Ray, St. Johns County Commissioner Bill McClure and former St. Johns Water Management District executive director Hans Tanzler III. Rutherford won the nomination with 38.7% of the vote, to Ray's 20.1%, Tanzler's 19.0%, and McClure's 9.8%. In the general election, Rutherford defeated Democratic nominee David Bruderly, 70.2% to 27.6%.


==== 2018 ====

In 2018, Rutherford was challenged by Democratic nominee Ges Selmont, a Ponte Vedra Beach attorney. He was reelected, 65.2% to 32.4%.


==== 2020 ====

In 2020, Rutherford won re-nomination in a low-key Republican primary, defeating retired Navy chief petty officer Erick Aguilar with 80.2% of the vote to Aguilar's 19.8%. In the general election, Rutherford defeated Democratic nominee Donna Deegan, a former local TV anchor and breast cancer awareness advocate, 61.1% to 38.9%.


==== 2022 ====

Rutherford won the Republican primary with 65.6% of the vote. He was uncontested in the general election.


==== 2024 ====

Rutherford is running for re-election in 2024.


=== Tenure ===
On January 11, 2017, Rutherford collapsed on the floor of the House, in what his staffers described as an "acute digestive flareup"; he was taken to the hospital, and released ten days later.


=== Committee assignments ===
For the 118th Congress:

Committee on Appropriations
Subcommittee on Homeland Security
Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies
Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies
Committee on Ethics


=== Caucus memberships ===
Republican Main Street Partnership
Congressional NextGen 9-1-1 Caucus
Congressional Coalition on Adoption
Rare Disease Caucus


=== Investigation ===
In February 2021, Rutherford joined the House Committee on Ethics. The Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) board filed a February 2022 report stating that there was "substantial reason to believe" Rutherford had not filed timely disclosure reports as required by federal law and House rules. The House Committee on Ethics released a report on May 31, 2022, indicating that it was investigating one of its members over repeated reporting violations of the STOCK Act, enacted in 2012 to prevent insider trading using non-public information by members of Congress and other government employees. Members of Congress are required to report any stock transaction over $1,000 within 45 days. Violations are subject to a $200 fine. Between January 2017 and December 2021, Rutherford had 157 late reports involving trades worth between $652,000 and $3.5 million. Most were from his first term, but the violations continued thereafter. The OCE report noted an $800 fine payment in November 2021 but asked whether Rutherford had been "properly penalized for his repeated violations of federal law and House rules". The OCE report also said that Rutherford and Jen Bailey, his chief of staff, were uncooperative by refusing to meet and answer questions. The fine for 157 violations would be $31,400. During his time in Congress, Rutherford had "several trainings on his disclosure obligations" for reporting stock transactions, according to the OCE report.
Rutherford initially contended that the stock trades are made by the manager of his IRA, so he should have been exempt from the reporting requirements. One of his lawyers, Kate Belinski, sent the OCE a letter on March 18, 2022, insisting that the late reports were "an entirely inadvertent oversight" based on a "simple misunderstanding of the requirements". She wrote that Rutherford had cooperated by providing the documents OCE requested. Belinski also claimed that Rutherford has a new system to track and file STOCK transactions. Rutherford said, "Everything is done, as far as I know. I paid the fine that they asked for, and I'm done with it."


== Political positions ==
Rutherford aligned himself with President Donald Trump, voting in line with Trump's position 96.6% of the time. He voted against a majority of fellow Republicans approximately 3.9% of the time.


=== Gun policy ===
In 2017, Rutherford signed a letter to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives expressing his support for legislation to ban bump stocks.
From 2015 to 2016, Rutherford received $1,000 in campaign donations from the NRA Political Victory Fund.
In 2018, Rutherford sponsored a bill, the STOP (Students, Teachers, and Officers Preventing) School Violence Act, that authorized $50 million a year to create a federal grant program "to train students, teachers and law enforcement on how to spot and report signs of gun violence"; the House approved the bill, 407–10. The bill authorized funding for the development of "anonymous telephone and online systems where people could report threats of violence" and $25 million for schools to "improve and harden their security, such as installing new locks, lights, metal detectors and panic buttons." A separate spending bill would be required to provide money for the grant program; Rutherford sought to include such funding as part of an omnibus spending bill.


=== Environment ===
In interviews in 2016 and 2019, he acknowledged the existence of climate change but questioned the scientific consensus that human activity has caused the increase in warming. Rutherford has expressed concern over sea level rise, which would adversely impact St. Augustine. He has criticized the Green New Deal proposal as a "socialist manifesto".
Rutherford and Representative Jeff Van Drew introduced the Atlantic Coastal Economies Protection Act, which would prohibit seismic air gun testing in the Atlantic Ocean. In 2019, in a break with Trump's position, Rutherford voted in favor of legislation to ban offshore drilling along the Atlantic coast, Pacific coast, and eastern Gulf of Mexico coast. In 2019, he introduced bipartisan legislation (cosponsored by eight Florida Democrats and nine Florida Republicans) to extend a moratorium on oil and gas drilling in federal waters off Florida's Gulf Coast until 2029, and to create a similar moratorium on offshore drilling in federal waters off Florida's South Atlantic coast and in the Straits of Florida.


=== Health care ===
Rutherford supported the unsuccessful 2017 effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act. In 2021, he sponsored legislation seeking to block the government from asking passengers on domestic flights whether they had been vaccinated against COVID-19.


=== LGBT rights ===
Rutherford voted against the Equality Act in 2019 and 2021.


=== Policing and criminal justice ===
Being one of two former sheriffs in Congress, Rutherford is "skeptical" of shorter prison sentences for nonviolent drug offenses. During his campaign for Congress, he called Black Lives Matter a "hate group".
Rutherford opposes capital punishment, citing his Catholic faith.


=== Economy, trade, and taxation ===
Rutherford voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, a measure he praised as good for the economy.


=== Foreign and military policy ===
Rutherford's district includes two major U.S. Navy bases (Naval Air Station Jacksonville and Naval Station Mayport), and he has pressed issues important to the bases. Like other members of Florida's delegation, he pressed for two squadrons of the F-35 Lightning II to be based in Jacksonville.


=== Donald Trump ===
Rutherford defended some of Trump's most controversial statements and actions as president, including his pardon of ex-sheriff Joe Arpaio and his comments after a deadly far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Rutherford voted against both Trump's first impeachment (in 2019, on articles of obstruction of Congress and abuse of power) and his second impeachment (in 2021, on an article of incitement of insurrection).


==== Effort to overturn 2020 election result ====

Rutherford refused to accept the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Trump lost to Joe Biden. He echoed Trump's claims of election fraud and suggested that Republican-controlled state legislatures in swing states Biden won could hold a "decertification vote" that would lead to the U.S. House selecting the next president, though he acknowledged that this was unlikely to succeed. On January 7, 2021, after the Capitol was attacked by a pro-Trump mob in an attempted insurrection, Rutherford was one of 138 House Republicans who voted not to count the electoral votes from Arizona and Pennsylvania, despite a number of audits and recounts confirming the election outcome in those states.
In December 2020, Rutherford was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the U.S. Supreme Court that sought to overturn the election results. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.
After Trump was impeached for his role in inciting a pro-Trump mob to storm the Capitol over false claims of election fraud, Rutherford condemned Representative Liz Cheney for voting to impeach Trump, accusing her of not being a "team player."


=== Immigration ===
In 2018, Rutherford defended the Trump administration policy of separating parents and children at the U.S.-Mexico border, and opposed legislation that would end the practice. After coming under pressure, Trump reversed his policy, a move Rutherford welcomed.
In 2017, Rutherford introduced legislation to create a path to citizenship for holders of E-2 Treaty Investor Visas, a special visa for business owners.


=== Social issues ===
Rutherford opposes abortion. In interviews in 2015, he contended that the U.S. had a "culture of death" he attributed to Roe v. Wade and violent video games and movies.
Rutherford opposes the legalization of marijuana. He voted against the 2014 ballot initiative to legal medicinal marijuana in Florida, believing that it would ultimately lead to the legalization of recreational marijuana and to marijuana "in every backpack in every high school in Duval County."


=== Other ===
Rutherford has supported the use of earmarks and has called for the elimination or restriction of the U.S. Senate rule that requires 60 Senate votes to invoke cloture (i.e., end debate on bills); he described both proposals as a way to facilitate compromise between the parties and reduce gridlock. Rutherford has said that he supports local referendums to resolve disputes over the fate of public Confederate monuments.


== Elections ==
Rutherford campaigned for Duval County sheriff, running against fellow Republicans David Anderson and Lem Sharp. In the election on April 15, 2003, he received 135,038 votes, 78% of the total. He took office on July 1, 2003. Rutherford was reelected in 2007 and 2011.
On August 30, 2016, he won the Republican primary for Florida's 4th Congressional District.

Michael John Haridopolos (born March 15, 1970) is an American politician, consultant, and educator currently serving as the U.S. representative from Florida's 8th congressional district. He previously served in the Florida Senate and was President of the Florida Senate from 2010 to 2012. He also served in the Florida House of Representatives from 2000 to 2003.
In 2024, Haridopolos was elected to the United States House of Representatives from Florida's 8th congressional district, an open seat following incumbent Bill Posey's decision not to seek reelection.


== Early life and education ==
Haridopolos was born in Huntington, New York, to his parents Ernie and Georgia Haridopolos. He is the son of a Greek immigrant who served as an FBI agent. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Stetson University in history and his Master of Arts degree in history from the University of Arkansas.


== Teaching career ==
Haridopolos taught United States History and Political Science at Brevard Community College—now Eastern Florida State College—starting in 1993.
Beginning in 2007, Haridopolos taught classes as an instructor at the Bob Graham Center at the University of Florida.


== Political career ==
In 2000, Haridopolos won an open seat in the Florida House, after winning a six-way Republican primary by over 30 percentage points and later won the November general election 65-35%. He won the 2002 Republican primary following re-apportionment with over 82% of the vote and was re-elected to the Florida House with 79% of the vote in the general election.
In January 2003, State Senator Howard Futch passed away, and a special election was called in order to elect a new senator. Haridopolos won the Republican Party primary with 84% of the vote, and he won 63% of the vote in the general election to win the remainder of the four-year senate term.
In 2008, Haridopolos passed on an open Congressional race with the retirement of Congressman Dave Weldon. Weldon and others asked Haridopolos to run, including the eventual nominee and now Congressman Bill Posey. Haridopolos endorsed Posey. Posey went on to win both the Republican primary and general election. Haridopolos said that he wanted to focus on his likely role as Senate President and continue his push to make the Florida Senate more conservative.
In both 2006 and 2010, Haridopolos was re-elected without opposition to the Florida Senate. Haridopolos actively supported conservative candidates throughout the state in the 2006, 2008, and 2010 election cycles. In the Florida Senate, Haridopolos served as Majority Whip from 2006 to 2008 and, in 2009, was elected President of the Senate. He was sworn in as Senate President on November 16, 2010, for a two-year term. He presided over the largest Republican majority (28-12) since Reconstruction. Before being sworn in, Haridopolos made headlines when he removed the doors from his Senate office, making a pledge to be transparent and accessible during his term as President.
Haridopolos is a co-founder of the Freedom Caucus, which has signed Americans for Tax Reform's Taxpayer Protection Pledge to "oppose and vote against any and all efforts to increase taxes" every year before the Legislature goes into session.

He sought the Republican nomination to challenge incumbent U.S. Senator Bill Nelson in 2012. The Washington Post identified him as "one of the state Republican Party's rising stars". On July 18, 2011, Haridopolos released a campaign video stating that he would no longer seek the nomination for the 2012 U.S. Senate seat, effectively ending his campaign.
His candidacy received a number of endorsements, including former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, U.S. Congressman Connie Mack, CFO Jeff Atwater, and Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam. He dropped out of the campaign in July 2011 in order to focus on his position as President of the Florida Senate.


== Term as Senate President ==
During his first term as Senate President, he oversaw the balancing of the state's budget which suffered a $4 billion shortfall.
That same year, the Senate also passed more than $300 million in tax relief, including a measure that effectively eliminates the corporate income tax burden for nearly half the roughly 30,000 Florida businesses that currently pay the tax; reformed Florida's entitlement programs, including the state's pension, welfare and Medicaid systems; reformed the state's education system; tightened regulations on unauthorized sales of habit-forming drugs; and reformed the state's growth management laws.


== Florida Innocence Commission ==
In 2005, Haridopolos supported a claim from Wilton Dedge that he had been convicted and wrongfully imprisoned for 22 years. He was exonerated by DNA testing in August 2004. The claim bill, which awarded Dedge $2 million in compensation, passed in the Florida Legislature during a special session in 2005. In 2010, he began to pursue the creation of an innocence commission. The commission sought to review cases where Floridians were possibly falsely imprisoned.

In 2012, Haridopolos helped pass two claims bills to compensate victims of wrongful imprisonment. One was a claim for William Dillon, who had been wrongfully incarcerated for 27 years. He was exonerated after DNA testing. He was compensated $1.35 million by the Florida Legislature. The other was for Eric Brody, who suffered catastrophic injuries after being struck by a police cruiser in 1999. He was compensated $10.75 million for ongoing medical care.
At the close of the 2012 Legislative Session, a News Service of Florida story noted that "Two lives may be changed for the better by the cash, a long-lasting effect of Haridopolos' persistence."


== Subsequent career ==
In 2019, Haridopolos co-authored The Modern Republican Party in Florida with Peter Dunbar, the book chronicles the rise of the Republican Party in Florida from the 1950s through the 2018 elections. He continued to teach at the University of Florida after he left the Florida Senate.
He owns and operates MJH Consulting. He has been a lobbyist in Florida. He is also active in both the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the Republican Governors Association.


== Personal life ==
Haridopolos is married to Stephanie and the couple have three children.

Daniel Alan Webster (born April 27, 1949) is an American businessman and politician serving as the U.S. representative for Florida's 11th congressional district since 2017. A member of the Republican Party, he first entered Congress in 2011. He represented Florida's 10th congressional district from 2011 to 2017 (numbered as the 8th district during his first term). Before his congressional service, he served 28 years in the Florida legislature. He was the first Republican Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives since Reconstruction.
After receiving his engineering degree from the Georgia Institute of Technology, Webster worked in the family air conditioning and heating business he now owns and operates. He has been a resident of Florida since the age of seven and resides in Clermont. First elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 1980 and the Florida Senate in 1998, Webster is the longest-serving legislator in Florida history. He became Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives (1996–1998) and Florida Senate Majority Leader (2006–2008); he left the legislature after reaching the legal term limits. He ran unopposed in all of his elections for the state legislature except for the first three: 1980, 1982, and 1984.
Webster was first elected to the United States House of Representatives in 2010. He has since run three times for Speaker of the House: in January 2015, he received 12 votes; in October 2015, he received nine votes; in 2017, he received one vote. In the 115th United States Congress, Webster sat on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, the Natural Resources Committee and the Science, Space and Technology Committee.


== Early life, education, business career, and health ==

Webster was born in Charleston, West Virginia, the son of Mildred Rada (Schoolcraft), a nurse, and Dennis Webster. He was raised in Orlando, Florida, where his family moved when Webster was seven, upon a doctor's recommendation that a change of climate might cure Webster's sinus problems. He is reportedly a distant relative of the antebellum politician and orator Daniel Webster.
He attended the Georgia Institute of Technology, where he was student government chaplain from 1970 to 1971 and a member of the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity. He graduated in 1971 with a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering. Upon graduation, Webster's Vietnam War student deferment expired, and he became eligible for conscription into the U.S. military, but was not drafted because he failed the physical exam due to lifelong foot problems that prevent him from standing for long periods.
Since college, Webster has worked in the family air conditioning and heating business; he presently owns and operates it. Webster lives in Clermont, Florida.
Webster said he and his wife faced health issues in 2021, which forced him to miss some votes. He said his wife had cancer surgery, and he had a pacemaker installed.


== Florida House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===
Webster first ran for the Florida House in 1979 at age 30. He had been working on a project with his church to convert a residential house into a place for Sunday school to be conducted. When the Orange County commissioners rejected the church's request for a zoning exception, Webster investigated and found that the county commission had rejected every zoning exemption request brought before them by a church or religious organization. Seeking to rectify what he thought was an injustice, Webster ran for public office after finding no politician who shared his displeasure with local and statewide government.
In the Republican primary, Webster ranked first with 38%, short of the 50% necessary to avoid a runoff election. In the runoff, he defeated Barbara Owens, 54%–46%. In the general election, he defeated Democratic State Representative Henry Swanson 51%–49%, a difference of just 2,070 votes. The race came down to one precinct, Webster's own Pine Hills, which he won.
After redistricting, Webster ran in Florida's newly redrawn 41st House District in 1982. He was reelected, defeating Craig Crawford 58%–42%. In 1984, he was reelected to a third term over fellow State Representative Dick Batchelor, 54%–46%.
After defeating Batchelor in 1984, Webster never had another opponent in the State House of Representatives and was reelected unopposed every two years.


=== Tenure ===
Webster was first elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 1980. There, he served as Minority Floor Leader and then Minority Whip. In 1996, when the Republicans gained a majority in the House, Webster became the first Republican Speaker of the Florida House in 122 years. He remained Speaker until 1998 when term limits made him ineligible to run for reelection.
During his tenure as Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, Webster received recognition and awards from several organizations, including the American Heart Association for support of AHA priority issues (1996), the Board of Regents Legislative Award (1995), the Florida Association of State Troopers Leadership Award for Excellence in Legislative Leadership (1996), the Florida Banking Association Award (1995), the Florida Chamber of Commerce Legislator of the Year (1995), the Florida Farm Bureau Legislative Award (1995), the Florida Hotel and Motel Association Special Recognition Award (1995), the Florida League of Cities Quality Floridian (1995), the Florida Medical Association recognition award (1996), and the Republican Party of Florida Statesman of the Year award (1995).

Education
Webster's first bill to become law was the 1985 Home Education Program Act, which legalized homeschooling in Florida. He considers it his most significant legislation. He homeschooled his six children, remains a homeschooling advocate, and a member of a non-denominational Christian organization that promotes homeschooling, the Institute in Basic Life Principles. While Speaker of the House in 1997, Webster insisted that legislation providing funding to schools must balance the needs of all school districts and not raise any taxes. He agreed to a school construction plan funded by borrowing up to $2.5 billion in bonds. However, he thought the crowding problem was being exaggerated for political purposes. He also sponsored 1998 legislation to improve and streamline pre-kindergarten education and provide training for parents who homeschooled their children.

Marriage
In 1990, Webster sponsored and supported legislation in Florida introducing the policy of covenant marriage. This would make divorce between even two consenting individuals much harder, except in cases of infidelity.


=== Committee assignments ===
House Transportation Committee (Ranking Member)


== Florida Senate ==


=== Elections ===
Webster ran unopposed for the Florida Senate in Florida's 12th and 9th Senate Districts. He served until reaching the term limit in 2008.


=== Tenure ===
In 2002, Webster unsuccessfully tried for the position of Senate President. From 2006 to 2008, he served as Senate Majority Leader. In 2006, while Majority Leader of the Florida Senate, he received the Florida Family Policy Council Award (2006).
The Florida Department of Transportation Turnpike District Headquarters was named the "Senator Daniel Webster Building" in 2008, and in 2005 State Road 429 was designated the "Daniel Webster Western Beltway". In addition, the largest committee room in the Florida House was named "Speaker Daniel Webster Hall" in his honor in 2008.

Drugs
In 2007, Webster attached an amendment to a bill for steroid testing of high school athletes that would have created an oversight body for private school athletes separate from the Florida High School Athletic Association. He said the provision was in response to complaints from private schools that had been allegedly singled out for recruiting violations.

Abortion
In 2008, Webster sponsored SB 2400 in the Florida Senate, requiring that all women planning to undergo an abortion receive an ultrasound, but giving them a choice of whether to see the live images of the fetus. He argued that it would give women more medical information before receiving an abortion, and said if that changed some women's minds, it would make him happy. Opponents said the measure would be an invasion of privacy. The bill did not pass the Senate then, but later became law. He also sponsored a law that would have required minors to notify their legal guardians before receiving an abortion. It has been alleged that Webster does not believe in the right to have an abortion following rape or incest. When questioned by a reporter on the topic, Webster declines to comment. He eventually said that this was an issue being used to distract from the real problem, which was that "Washington is broken."

Schiavo case
Webster was a central figure in the Terri Schiavo case, which involved a dispute between relatives on whether to remove the feeding tube of an unconscious woman who had been in a persistent vegetative state for years. In March 2005, he introduced SB 804, which would have prohibited such patients from being denied food and water if family members disagreed with the patient's wishes and if the patient had not expressed their wishes in writing when competent. The bill failed to pass the Senate by three votes.


=== Committee assignments ===
He also chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 2010 ====

Webster rejected early suggestions by several leaders in the Republican Party of Florida that he run to represent Florida's 8th congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives. Still, in April 2010, he changed his mind and entered the race. His name recognition and an endorsement from former Governor of Florida Jeb Bush quickly made him the front-runner. He was further aided by a late endorsement and campaign rally from former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee. On August 24, 2010, Webster defeated six other candidates in the Republican primary, winning nomination with 40% of the vote, to the runner-up's 23%. Webster was named one of 52 "Young Guns" of the National Republican Congressional Committee's Young Guns Program, those the party viewed as serious contenders in their races.
The campaign featured ads by opponent Alan Grayson that criticized Webster's conservative religious views on marriage and abortion as well as attack ads against Grayson financed by Americans for Prosperity and the 60 Plus Association.
In July 2010, Webster signed a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity promising to "oppose legislation relating to climate change that includes a net increase in government revenue."
On November 2, 2010, Webster won the seat, 56% to 38%. Three other candidates were on the ballot: Independent George Metcalfe, Florida Whig Party candidate Steve Gerritzen, and Peg Dunmire of the Florida TEA Party.


==== 2012 ====

Due to redistricting, Webster ran for reelection in the 10th district. Webster defeated Val Demings, the former Chief of Police of the Orlando Police Department, 52% to 48%.


==== 2014 ====

Webster faced former Navy Chief Petty Officer Mike McKenna, a Walt Disney World security officer. McKenna had a minimal budget and ran a door-to-door campaign. Webster was reelected, 62% to 38%.


==== 2016 ====

Due to a series of court-ordered re-drawings that made the 10th substantially more Democratic, Webster announced he would run in the 11th district instead. The district's incumbent, fellow Republican Rich Nugent, was retiring. Webster had previously represented much of the redrawn 11th's eastern portion, around Ocala and The Villages. He opted to maintain his residence in Clermont, within the borders of the 10th; members of Congress are required only to live in the state they wish to represent. Webster won the Republican primary 60%–40% over Justin Grabelle. He defeated Democratic nominee Dave Koller, 65%–32%.


==== 2018 ====

Webster ran for reelection in 2018 for the 11th District. No Republican candidates opposed Webster, so he advanced to the general election. Webster defeated Democratic nominee Dana Cottrell, 65%–35%.


==== 2020 ====

Webster ran for reelection in 2020 for the 11th District. No Republican candidates opposed Webster, so he advanced to the general election, again defeating Cottrell by a similar margin (67%–33%).


==== 2022 ====

Webster ran for reelection in 2022 for the 11th District. The boundaries of the district were redrawn by the 2020 redistricting cycle, resulting in a district that once again included his hometown of Winter Garden, and one that was described as "Safe R" or "Solid R" by numerous outlets. Webster faced a primary challenger in far-right activist Laura Loomer. Webster managed to hold off the challenge and won the nomination by a close margin of 51%–44%. In the general election, Webster easily defeated Democrat Shante Munns by 63%–35%.


=== Missed votes ===
Webster has missed 5.5% of roll-call votes during his tenure in Congress, which is worse than the median of 2.1% for members serving in Congress, according to GovTrack, a nonpartisan government watchdog group.
Webster did not vote on President Donald Trump's second impeachment.
Webster did not vote on H.Res 503, the measure that established the January 6 Select Committee.


=== Tenure ===
Webster's main platform in the 2010 election was a call for smaller, streamlined government, spending cuts, budget roll backs, and tax cuts. He also said he would increase the protection of personal rights and encourage financial responsibility in the federal government. Webster predicted that if Republicans took back Congress, "we would have the opportunity for turning this country around." In the January 2015 vote for Speaker of the House, Webster received the second-most Republican votes.
On September 28, 2015, Webster announced that he was running again for Speaker of the House to replace John Boehner. He received 43 votes in the House GOP Conference. Still, most members of the Freedom Caucus who voted for him in conference honored their pledge to support Ryan on the House floor, and Webster received nine votes in the final tally.
Despite not being a candidate in the 2017 speakership election, Webster received one vote from Thomas Massie of Kentucky.


=== Committee assignments ===
For the 118th Congress:

Committee on Natural Resources
Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources
Subcommittee on Water, Wildlife and Fisheries
Committee on Science, Space, and Technology
Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure
Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation (Chairman)
Subcommittee on Highways and Transit
Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment


== 2004 U.S. Senate election ==

Webster briefly ran for the United States Senate in 2004 when he attempted to collect the 93,000 signatures necessary to place his name on the ballot without paying the filing fee. Webster claimed that he sought to be the first Senate candidate to ever qualify by this method as a symbolic gesture and a way to build an early network of voters. He eventually qualified by paying the fee instead and later dropped out of the race.
When Mel Martinez resigned from the United States Senate, it fell upon Governor Charlie Crist to name a replacement to finish out his Senate term. Webster was floated early on as one of seven potential candidates. In the end, George LeMieux was selected for the position.


== Political positions ==
Webster's campaign website, Daniel Webster for Congress, describes him as a committed conservative.


=== Education ===
Webster is an advocate for home schooling.


=== Gun law ===
Webster supports allowing gun owners to carry concealed firearms across state lines where concealed carry is legal. In 2017, he voted for H.J.Res.40, which successfully used the Congressional Review Act to block implementation of an Obama-era amendment to the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 that was aimed at preventing the mentally impaired from legally purchasing firearms.
In 2015–2016, Webster accepted $1,000 in direct campaign contributions from the NRA Political Victory Fund. From 2004 to 2018, he accepted $37,881 from NRA sources. Webster has an "A" rating from the NRA, generally indicating a voting record that supports gun rights.


=== LGBT rights ===
Webster has a "0" rating from the Human Rights Campaign regarding his voting record on LGBT-related matters. He co-sponsored the First Amendment Defense Act. He does not support same-sex marriage.


=== Social issues ===


==== Abortion ====
Webster opposes abortion under all circumstances.


==== Cannabis ====
Webster has a "D" rating from NORML for his voting history regarding cannabis-related causes. He is against veterans having access to medical marijuana if recommended by their Veterans Health Administration doctor and if it is legal for medicinal purposes in their state of residence.


=== Tax reform ===
Webster voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. He believes the current tax code is "punishing taxpayers" and is broken. He says the 2017 act "allows Americans to keep more money in their pockets, ends lobbyist loopholes and special-interest exemptions, and makes everyone play by the same rules." He says "the majority" of his constituents will be "among the biggest winners in the nation" due to the new tax policies.


=== Donald Trump ===


==== Texas v. Pennsylvania ====
In December 2020, Webster was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated incumbent Donald Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a statement that called signing the amicus brief an act of "election subversion." She also reprimanded Webster and the other House members who supported the lawsuit: "The 126 Republican Members that signed onto this lawsuit brought dishonor to the House. Instead of upholding their oath to support and defend the Constitution, they chose to subvert the Constitution and undermine public trust in our sacred democratic institutions." New Jersey Representative Bill Pascrell, citing section three of the 14th Amendment, called for Pelosi to not seat Webster and the other Republicans who signed the brief supporting the suit, arguing that "the text of the 14th Amendment expressly forbids Members of Congress from engaging in rebellion against the United States. Trying to overturn a democratic election and install a dictator seems like a pretty clear example of that."


==== Second impeachment ====
Webster did not cast a vote regarding the second impeachment of Donald Trump on January 13, 2021, due to a "family medical obligation".


== Personal life ==
Webster is a Southern Baptist and attends First Baptist Church of Central Florida.  He is on the University of Central Florida board of trustees. He and his wife, Sandra E. "Sandy" (Jordan) Webster, have six children. As of 2018, they have 17 grandchildren.
The Websters home-schooled their children using the curriculum of the Advanced Training Institute, founded by Bill Gothard. In May 2014, their son John married Alyssa Bates, daughter of Gil and Kelly Bates. The Bates family starred in the reality show Bringing Up Bates and were recurring guests on the show 19 Kids and Counting, which depicted the lives of their friends, Jim Bob Duggar and his wife Michelle.

Gus Michael Bilirakis ( BIL-ih-RAK-iss; born February 8, 1963) is an American lawyer and politician serving as the U.S. representative for Florida's 12th congressional district since 2013. A member of the Republican Party, he first entered Congress in 2007, where he succeeded his father Michael Bilirakis, representing Florida's 9th congressional district until redistricting. His district includes much of the northern portion of the Tampa Bay area. Bilirakis previously served as the Florida state representative for the 48th district from 1998 to 2006.


== Early life and education ==
Bilirakis was born in Gainesville, Florida, and grew up in Tarpon Springs, Florida, the son of Evelyn (née Miaoulis) and Michael Bilirakis. He lives in Palm Harbor and is the grandson of Greek immigrants. His grandfather owned a local bakery where Bilirakis worked from a young age.
Bilirakis graduated from Tarpon Springs High School and St. Petersburg Junior College. He then attended the University of Florida, where he graduated in 1986 with a bachelor's degree in political science. He received his J.D. degree from the Stetson University College of Law in 1989. He was an intern for U.S. President Ronald Reagan.


== Career ==
Bilirakis operated a law practice, the Bilirakis Law Group, specializing in probate and estate planning, which he took over from his father, Michael Bilirakis. His father served in Congress from 1983 to 2007, and Gus helped run his campaigns.


=== Florida legislature ===


==== Tenure ====
Bilirakis was first elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 1998 when he won the District 48 seat held for 10 years by Representative Sandy Safley, R-Clearwater, who decided not to run again. This district covers most of north Pinellas County, part of Pasco County, and part of Hillsborough County.


==== Committees ====
During his tenure in Tallahassee (1998–2006), he chaired several panels including Crime Prevention, Public Safety Appropriations, and the Economic Development, Trade, & Banking Committee.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===

In 2006, Michael Bilirakis announced his retirement after 24 years in Congress, and Gus Bilirakis entered the race to succeed his father in what was then the 9th District. He defeated Hillsborough County Commissioner Phyllis Busansky in the general election with 55% of the vote to become the district's second representative. He has been reelected three more times without substantive opposition.


=== Committee assignments ===

For the 118th Congress:

Committee on Energy and Commerce
Subcommittee on Communications and Technology
Subcommittee on Health
Subcommittee on Innovation, Data, and Commerce (Chairman)


=== Caucus membership ===
Bilirakis and Representative Ted Deutch formed the Congressional Hellenic-Israeli Alliance in February 2013.

Republican Study Committee
Co-chair of Congressional Diabetes Caucus
Congressional Coalition on Adoption


=== Tenure ===
Bilirakis is a member of the Republican Party's Whip Team and is Chair of the Veterans’ Affairs Task Force for the Republican Policy Committee. Additionally, Bilirakis serves as a co-chair of the Congressional Military Veterans Caucus and the Congressional Caucus on Hellenic Issues.
He is a signer of the Taxpayer Protection Pledge and a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity promising to vote against any climate change legislation that would raise taxes.

In 2022, Bilirakis voted against naming a federal building in Florida after Joseph W. Hatchett, the first Black State Supreme Court judge in Florida and south of the Mason-Dixon line. 


== Political positions ==


=== Healthcare ===
Bilirakis supports repealing the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.
On February 11, 2017, Bilirakis hosted a townhall in Pasco County, Florida, where he was faced with several protesters angry over the potential repeal of the Affordable Care Act, when a member of the local party (an unauthorized speaker for the county REC), Bill Akins repeated the now debunked claim that the ACA contains "what is effectively known as death panels". Bilirakis nodded in agreement and later told CNN, "The board exists, OK? And I've voted to repeal the board." Bilirakis seemed to equate the "death panel" with the Independent Advisory Board, a 15-member committee that issues recommendations for reducing healthcare costs, subject to congressional oversight and approval.
In early October 2018, Bilirakis released a campaign advertisement touting his work fighting opioids in Pasco County, Florida. In the advertisement, he took credit for a law he did not have a hand in crafting. The 30-second ad flashed text about a "Bilirakis INTERDICT ACT" as Pasco County Sheriff Chris Nocco said Bilirakis is "giving us the tools to do our job and get traffickers off the street". The INTERDICT Act provides funding and equipment to U.S. Customs and Border Protection for detecting imported fentanyl. But Bilirakis was neither a sponsor nor one of 18 co-sponsors, making it unclear how it is the "Bilirakis INTERDICT Act".


=== Tax policy ===
Bilirakis voted in favor of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.


=== Gun policy ===
From 2015 to 2016, Bilirakis accepted $2,000 in direct campaign contributions from the NRA's Political Victory Fund; As of 2017, he has an "A" rating from the NRA, indicating a voting record that is generally pro-gun rights.
As a U.S. Representative, Bilirakis has voted on several pieces of legislation pertaining to firearms. He supported H. R. 38, which would enable concealed carry reciprocity among all states if and when it is signed into law.
In March 2017, Bilirakis voted for the Veterans Second Amendment Protection Act, which, if signed into law, would prohibit, in any case arising out of the administration of laws and benefits by the Department of Veterans Affairs, any person who is mentally incapacitated, deemed mentally incompetent, or experiencing an extended loss of consciousness, of the right to receive or transport firearms, without the order or finding of a judicial authority of competent jurisdiction.
After the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, Bilirakis signed a letter written to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, urging it to reevaluate the legal status of bump stocks. No action had been taken as of March 2018.
In the wake of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in 2018, Bilirakis said that he would be willing to consider gun control legislation, "if that's what it takes". He said that, specifically, he would support more school resource officers in schools. He also announced his support for legislation that would ensure "that those who are mentally ill do not have access to weapons".


=== Nagorno-Karabakh war ===
On October 1, 2020, Bilirakis co-signed a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that condemned Azerbaijan's offensive operations against the Armenian-populated enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, denounced Turkey's role in the Nagorno-Karabakh war, and called for an immediate ceasefire.


=== Israel ===
Bilirakis voted to provide Israel with support following 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.


== 2020 presidential election ==
In December 2020, Bilirakis was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated incumbent Donald Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.
In an editorial, the Tampa Bay Times wrote that Bilirakis "chose partisan games over national interest". The Orlando Sentinel published an editorial calling the signers of the amicus brief a "national embarrassment", a "danger to democracy", and the "Sedition Caucus". House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a statement that called signing the amicus brief an act of "election subversion".
Many of the signers of the Texas v. Pennsylvania amicus brief objected to the certification of the 2020 Electoral College vote, but Bilirakis was absent due to contracting COVID-19.
As a result of Donald Trump's  role in the 2021 United States Capitol attack, the House of Representatives impeached Trump a second time. Bilirakis voted against impeachment, calling it "politically motivated" and a "highly polarizing ruse that will only further divide Americans".


== Personal life ==
Bilirakis has four children and is an Eastern Orthodox Christian.
In 2014, Bilirakis had a cameo as a job applicant in the feature film Walt Before Mickey starring Thomas Ian Nicholas, Jon Heder, and Armando Gutierrez.


== Foreign honors ==

Vernon Gale Buchanan ( bew-KAN-ən; born May 8, 1951) is an American businessman and politician serving as the U.S. representative for Florida's 16th congressional district since 2013. A member of the Republican Party, he first entered Congress in 2007, representing Florida's 13th congressional district until redistricting. His district is anchored by Bradenton.
Buchanan is the only Republican member from Florida on the House Ways and Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over tax policy, international trade, health care and Social Security. Before serving in Congress, Buchanan was in business for over 30 years and chaired both the Greater Sarasota Chamber of Commerce and Florida Chamber of Commerce. He served as a member of the board and the executive committee of the United States Chamber of Commerce.


== Early life and education ==
Buchanan grew up in Inkster, Michigan, a small town outside Detroit, the son of a factory foreman in a family of six children. His maternal grandparents immigrated to the United States from Finland. When he graduated from high school in 1969, he joined the Michigan Air National Guard, serving there for six years. Buchanan got a bachelor's degree in business administration from Cleary University and a master's in business administration from the University of Detroit.


== Business career ==
In his June 2007 financial disclosure filing, Buchanan reported over $100 million in assets, making him among the five wealthiest members of Congress. Most of his wealth is from his automotive empire, which includes several dealerships in Florida. He also reported ownership interests in about 50 other businesses, including offshore reinsurance companies and a charter-jet business. He reported receiving at least $19.5 million in income from these businesses in 2006.


=== American Speedy Printing ===
In May 1976, Buchanan convinced the owner of a Michigan printing company, Jim McDonald, that he could help the business grow. The two founded American Speedy Printing, which grew through franchising to more than 730 stores in 44 states. Later, Buchanan and American Speedy Printing were defendants in a string of lawsuits during the late 1980s and early 1990s by franchisees and master franchisees, who said they were not making the money that Buchanan had said they could expect. After filing for bankruptcy, he was accused by a creditors' committee of taking excessive compensation and actions that resulted in overstated earnings for American Speedy Printing. In a 1995 deposition, he said that he had no personal obligation to repay a large corporate loan from Merrill Lynch. A dispute with the Internal Revenue Service over taxes on the money Buchanan received from Merrill Lynch stretched through the 1990s. Buchanan, his business partner, and Merrill Lynch were sued for violating the Michigan Corporation Act. It ended with Buchanan paying $1.5 million.


=== Car dealerships ===
In 1992, Buchanan bought a Honda and Acura dealership in Ocala, Florida. In late 1999, he bought two more dealerships. He continued to acquire dealerships after that, but in 2006 he sold five dealerships and other businesses in order to concentrate on politics. His dealerships had $756 million in sales in 2005.


=== Reinsurance companies ===
Buchanan owns two reinsurance companies—Jamat Reinsurance Co. and Buchanan Reinsurance Co., in Turks and Caicos, and part of the Bermuda reinsurance company Greater Atlantic Insurance Co. The three companies offer extended warranty policies to car buyers. Buchanan invests some of the proceeds from his reinsurance companies in real estate developments in the Bahamas.


=== Ritz-Carlton ===
In 1999, Buchanan was approached to help to finance the Ritz-Carlton condo-hotel development in Sarasota. Buchanan was cut out of the project. The developers, Robert Buford and Kevin Daves, said he lied about his financial means. Buchanan sued, and the parties settled in 2001. Per a structured settlement, Buchanan bought a condo from a nephew of Buford's for $5 million; the nephew had purchased it the day before for $2.368 million. Buchanan owned the unit for a little more than a year and then sold it to another member of Buford's family for $6.35 million. The arrangement resulted in Buchanan paying taxes on his gain at the reduced long-term capital gains rate. Buford benefited from the apartment's increased appraised value and the use of Buchanan's $5 million. In the year he owned the penthouse, Buchanan used it for charity fundraisers.


=== PPP loans and criticism ===
In 2022, Buchanan had $2.3 million in PPP loans forgiven. Buchanan was criticized for his hypocrisy regarding President Biden's student loan debt forgiveness.


== Political campaigns ==


=== 2006 ===


==== Primary election ====
Buchanan ran in the 13th congressional district in Florida to replace incumbent Republican Katherine Harris, who was the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate. Buchanan won the Republican primary with 32% of the vote, against four opponents. His closest challengers were Nancy C. Detert, with 25% of the vote, and Tramm Hudson, with 24%.
In the November general election, Buchanan faced Democrat Christine Jennings, a banking executive. There were 216,000 registered Republicans and about 155,000 registered Democrats in the district, but Jennings polled ahead of Buchanan up to election day. Buchanan put more than $5 million of his own money into his campaign.
In October, Vice President Dick Cheney held a fund-raising luncheon for Buchanan; later that month, President George W. Bush held a fund-raising reception for him. Between the two events, Governor Jeb Bush, Senator Mel Martinez, and Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney came to the district to campaign for Buchanan.


==== General election ====
Initial results of the November election showed Buchanan leading by less than 350 votes. Due to the closeness of the race, and a high undervote of 18,000 in Sarasota County, a recount was ordered. Sarasota County voters had given more votes to a hospital board than they had to their Congressional representative—with 13% of voters not voting, compared to an average of 2% in neighboring counties. The touch-screen voting machines used provided no paper record. On November 20, 2006, the Florida Department of State certified the results of the recount, which showed Buchanan winning by 369 votes.
Jennings challenged the results of the election in court, citing "pervasive malfunctioning of electronic voting machines." In December 2006, a Florida circuit judge ruled that her claim that voting machines in Sarasota County lost up to 18,000 votes was "conjecture" and didn't warrant overriding the trade secrets of the voting machine company. In June 2007, a Florida state appellate court ruled that Jennings did not meet the "extraordinary burden" of proving the lower court judge was wrong. Another suit, filed by voters represented by Voter Action, People For the American Way Foundation, the ACLU of Florida, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation was also dismissed.
The U.S. House of Representatives had the right to make the final determination as to whether Buchanan would hold the seat for the remainder of the term or be replaced by Jennings. In April, a three-person House task force was created to evaluate the election. In early May, the task force voted along party lines to refer an investigation into Florida's 13th district House race to the Government Accountability Office (GAO). On February 25, 2008, the committee and the House accepted the GAO's findings that no machine error was demonstrated as sufficient to have altered the outcome of the election. The House passed HR 989 affirming the committee's findings, accepting the results of the race, and formally dismissing Jennings's challenge of the election results. Jennings formally dropped her challenge shortly thereafter to focus on a 2008 rematch against Buchanan.


=== 2008 ===

Buchanan defeated Jennings with 55% of the vote to her 38%. On election night, he said, "What a difference two years makes."


=== 2010 ===

In May 2009, Buchanan announced his candidacy for reelection. He defeated Don Baldauf in the Republican primary, and Reverend James T. Golden in the general, with 68.9% of the vote.


=== 2012 ===

In 2012, Buchanan defeated Democratic former state representative Keith Fitzgerald with 53.6% of the vote. This is his narrowest victory since 2006.


=== 2014 ===

In 2014, Buchanan defeated Democratic nominee Henry Lawrence with 61.5% of the vote to Lawrence's 38.4%.


=== 2016 ===

In 2016, Buchanan defeated Democratic nominee Jan Schneider, an attorney and author, with 59.8% of the vote to Schneider's 40.2%.


==== Results ====


=== 2018 ===

In 2018, Buchanan defeated the Democratic nominee, attorney David Shapiro, with 54.6% of the vote.


=== 2020 ===

In 2020, Buchanan defeated Democratic nominee Margaret Good with 55.5% of the vote. Good defeated Buchanan's son James in a closely watched special election in 2018.
In February 2021, Buchanan announced his candidacy for reelection in 2022.


=== 2022 ===

In 2022, Buchanan won a 9th term by defeating Democratic nominee Jan Schneider, who was the previous nominee in 2016, with 62% of the vote. Buchanan's constituency changed as a result of the 2020 redistricting cycle. The new 16th district no longer encompasses Sarasota county.


=== 2024 ===
Buchanan faced his biggest primary challenge to date against Eddie Speir. Buchanan won by 20 points with 60% of the vote to Speir's 40%. Buchanan was endorsed by former President Donald Trump


== Criminal investigations ==

In July 2012, the House Ethics Committee cleared Buchanan of charges that he violated House rules by misleading Congress in his financial disclosure forms. After the issue was raised, Buchanan submitted revised forms. The committee "found no evidence that the errors were knowing or willful and unanimously determined that the errors were not substantively different from the hundreds or thousands of errors corrected by amendment at the requirement of the Committee every year."
In 2008, the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) filed a Federal Election Commission (FEC) complaint alleging "straw donors" to Buchanan's campaign (campaign contributions from Buchanan's employees for which they were then reimbursed); in 2011, CREW requested a U.S. Department of Justice investigation. (The group also named Buchanan to its annual "most corrupt members of Congress" list in 2008, 2009, 2011, and 2012).
By 2012, Buchanan was being investigated by the House Ethics Committee, the FEC, the Justice Department, and the Office of Congressional Ethics over two separate allegations of campaign finance misconduct: that he had violated federal law and House rules by coercing a former business partner to sign a false affidavit to the FEC, and that he had illegally reimbursed car-dealership employees for campaign contributions. The latter allegation was also raised in a legal dispute with Sam Kazran, Buchanan's former business partner, who alleged that Buchanan engaged in a "cash swap scheme" in which employees were directed to write checks to Buchanan's campaign fund, then reimbursed by the company.
In 2012, the Justice Department ended its 11-month investigation with no criminal charges. The FEC also ended its investigation by 2012. Kazran agreed to pay $5,500 in fines "for improperly funneling money to Buchanan's campaign committee", and in May 2013 three men and two Tampa companies were fined a total of $16,000 by the FEC for illegal campaign contributions to Buchanan. In 2016, after a four-year inquiry, the House Ethics Committee ended its investigation, finding "insufficient evidence" of wrongdoing on Buchanan's part.
Kazran filed a separate breach of contract lawsuit against Buchanan in Florida state court; Buchanan prevailed in that litigation.
Beginning in 2008, Buchanan faced lawsuits by six former employees, who alleged "conspiracy, fraud, and retaliatory personnel actions" as well as the hiring of undocumented immigrants and consumer fraud. None of those cases made it to trial and by 2011 most had been "dismissed with no judgments against Buchanan."
On June 23, 2016, the House Ethics Committee released this statement, concluding its investigation into Buchanan: "Because the evidence is insufficient to conclude that Representative Buchanan himself was aware of the unlawful reimbursements at the time they occurred, or had any role in directing or approving of them, and the evidence is insufficient to find that Representative Buchanan attempted to improperly influence the testimony of Mr. Kazran before the FEC, the Committee has determined to take no further action in this matter, and upon publication of this Report, considers the matter closed."

=== Tenure ===
Buchanan was sworn in as Representative for Florida's 13th Congressional District on January 3, 2007. Congressional Quarterly noted that Buchanan voted in support of President Bush's legislative agenda 66% of the time in 2007, the third-lowest rate of the 16 members of Florida's Republican congressional delegation.
Buchanan secured federal funding of $2 million for reimbursement for cleanup efforts in Anna Maria Island and $4 million for cleaning up Wares Creek in Manatee County.
Buchanan introduced a constitutional amendment in January 2007 that would require Congress to pass a balanced budget if ratified. He introduced legislation to create a postage stamp honoring and assisting disabled veterans, and secured funding for the construction of a national veterans' cemetery in Sarasota County. He also introduced a bill to increase federal assistance for fighting gang crime and secured grant funding for local anti-gang efforts in Manatee County.
As of July 2008, Buchanan had voted to override five of Bush's vetoes of legislation passed by the 110th Congress. These override votes included a vote in support of expanding the coverage range of the SCHIP program, the 2008 farm bill, and the Water Resources Development Act.
On September 29, 2008, Buchanan voted against the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, but changed his vote to support the bill in the October 3 second House vote.
Buchanan sponsored several bills in the 111th Congress, including House Resolution 1839, a Bill to Amend the Small Business Act to Improve SCORE (Service Corps of Retired Executives), which was introduced on April 1, 2009c. House Resolution 1839 would require the administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) to ensure that SCORE increases the proportion of small business mentors from socially or economically disadvantaged backgrounds, establish benchmarks for evaluating its activities and volunteers, and establish a mentoring program of one-on-one advice to small businesses from qualified counselors.
In the 112th Congress, Buchanan was named to a seat on the Ways and Means Committee, the only member from Florida serving on that committee. He was also asked by NRCC Chairman Pete Sessions to serve as vice chair of the committee.
In January 2011, Buchanan helped secure the construction of Sarasota National Cemetery through the Department of Veterans Affairs. The cemetery plans include 11,500 grave sites, 16,000 cremated remains sites, and other buildings and structures necessary for funerals for veterans and their families.
In June 2011, the House passed Buchanan's Military Tribunals for Terrorists Act as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012. The amendment, approved by a largely party-line vote of 246–173, would "require all foreign terrorism suspects to be tried only in military tribunals and never in civilian courts."
In October 2011, Buchanan "played a large role" in the passage of free trade agreements with Colombia, Panama and South Korea. The treaties were backed by the White House and a bipartisan majority in Congress.
In December 2011, the House passed H.R. 527, a Buchanan-backed measure to close "loopholes in current law to ensure regulatory agencies will fully account for the effect of new regulations on small businesses before regulations are adopted."
In February 2012, Buchanan supported President Obama's proposal to lower the corporate tax rate from 35% to 28%. In a statement, Buchanan said, "I appreciate the president's willingness to engage on such an important issue."
In 2011, Buchanan and Representative Ed Markey introduced the Pill Mill Crackdown Act of 2011, legislation that would require money seized from so-called pill mills to be directed to drug treatment programs; "increase fines and sentences for those convicted of running pill mills"; and make hydrocodone drugs such as Vicodin more difficult to obtain. The bill received bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate (where introduced companion bill was introduced), but never made it out of committee.

After the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, Buchanan indicated support for regulation of bump stocks, saying, "Bump stocks generating automatic rates of fire should face the same restrictions as automatic weapons." After the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, Giffords, an organization helmed by Gabby Giffords, announced that Buchanan was on its "incumbent-defeat priority list" in response to the organization's perception that Republican Congress members are blocking efforts to reduce gun violence.
In March 2021, Buchanan was one of eight Republicans to join the House majority in passing the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021.

Earl LeRoy "Buddy" Carter  (born September 6, 1957) is an American pharmacist and politician serving as the U.S. representative for Georgia's 1st congressional district since 2015. The district is based in Savannah and includes most of the state's coastal southern portion. A member of the Republican Party, Carter served as a Georgia state representative (2005–2009) and Georgia state senator (2009–2014).


== Early life and education ==
Carter graduated in 1975 from Robert W. Groves High School in Garden City, Georgia. He earned an associate degree from Young Harris College in 1977 and a Bachelor of Science in pharmacy from the University of Georgia in 1980. Carter was conferred the honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree by Young Harris College at its 2024 commencement ceremony.
Carter is a Methodist.
He is not related to former U.S. President and fellow Georgian Jimmy Carter.


== Political career ==
Carter served on the planning and zoning commission for the city of Pooler from 1989 to 1993 and on Pooler's city council from 1994 to 1995. He served as Pooler's mayor from 1996 to 2004. Carter was first elected to the state legislature in 2005, serving two terms in the Georgia House of Representatives from 2006 to 2010. He was elected to the Georgia Senate in 2009. He sat on the Senate Appropriations, Health and Human Services, Higher Education, and Public Safety committees.
In March 2014, a controversy emerged regarding S.B. 408, a bill authored by Carter that would increase reimbursement rates for pharmacies in Georgia. As he is the owner of three pharmacies that would see increased profits as a result of the bill, many considered his vote in violation of the Senate's ethical guidelines. "Obviously, it's borderline," he admitted.
Carter gave up his state senate seat in 2014 to run for Congress after 22-year incumbent Jack Kingston announced he was running for the United States Senate. He finished first in the six-way Republican primary–the real contest in this heavily Republican district–with 36% of the vote, well short of the 51% required for outright victory. He then defeated Bob Johnson in the runoff with 53% of the vote. In the general election, he defeated the Democratic nominee, Brian Reese, with 60.9% of the vote, carrying all but two counties in the district. In 2016, he was unopposed in both the primary and general elections, and took over 99% of the vote against a write-in candidate.
Carter was reelected in 2018, 2020, and 2022. The Democratic challengers both years were the first since 1992 to clear 40% of the vote in the district.
Carter has considered running against Democratic incumbent Jon Ossoff in the 2026 United States Senate election in Georgia.
In May 2023, Carter listed a property in Camden County, Georgia, for sale for $4.25 million after having purchased it in 2018 for $2.05 million. He had not listed the property in his Congressional financial disclosures and instead said he had not bought the property as an investment. Shortly after purchasing the property he urged the FAA to issue Camden a launch site operator's license, which would have increased the value of his property tremendously, but he did not disclose that he owned nearby property in his letter.


== Political positions ==


=== 2020 presidential election ===
On January 6, 2021, in a vote held after protestors stormed the U.S. Capitol, Carter voted against certifying the 2020 presidential election due to unfounded claims made by the president, a vote he has continued to defend, saying it "will be a cold day in hell" before he apologizes for it.


=== Drug policy ===
The marijuana legalization advocacy organization NORML has rated Carter a "D".
Carter voted against the Veterans Equal Access Amendment in 2015 and 2016 (which would expand access to medical marijuana for veterans), against the McClintock/Polis Amendment in 2015 (which would prevent the Department of Justice from prosecuting federal marijuana offenses that are legal in the state) and against the Rohrabacher/Farr Amendment in 2015 (which would prevent federal officials from interfering with a state's medical marijuana program).
In 2017, Carter renewed his push to drug-test people who receive unemployment insurance.
Carter is against cannabis legalization. He has called it "nothing more than a gateway drug". On April 1, 2022, Carter voted against the MORE Act, which would have decriminalized cannabis at the federal level, allowing states to set their own policies.


=== Health care ===
Carter supports the repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). He has said that there is no circumstance that would induce him to vote in favor of keeping the ACA, including if most of his constituents were in favor of it.
On July 26, 2017, Carter was asked during a live television interview if he supported Trump's criticism of U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski for her opposition to the procedural vote to begin the Senate's healthcare debate. Carter said he did, adding, "Somebody needs to go over there to that Senate and snatch a knot in their ass." The incident prompted widespread media coverage.
In 2024, Carter introduced a bipartison bill that would promote innovation for animal-free drug testing, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Modernization Act 3.0.


=== Tax reform ===
Carter voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, saying he believed it would make businesses in his district more competitive in a global market. He also said it would help his constituents earn and/or save more money. Carter is a sponsor of "H.R.25 The FairTax Act of 2023" which would abolish the current US tax structure and replace it with a yearly adjustable variable "national sales tax" (value-added tax) starting at 23% in 2025 to be administered by the states and remitted to the Treasury of the United States.


=== Immigration ===
Carter co-sponsored a bill that would let illegal immigrants serve in the U.S. military in exchange for legal residency.
Carter supported Trump's 2017 executive order to temporarily curtail immigration from seven countries until better screening methods are devised. He said, "While I believe there needs to be thoughtful clarifications on the executive actions similar to Secretary Kelly’s announcement about lawful permanent residents, the number one priority of the federal government is to provide for the common defense."
Carter wants to prohibit all federal funding from sanctuary cities in Georgia (sanctuary cities prohibit city officials from asking about a person's immigration status when they report an unrelated crime). He also said he would like to test the huge backlog of rape kits in Georgia, except in sanctuary cities.


=== Abortion ===
Carter opposes abortion. He cosponsored the Sanctity of Human Life Act (H.R. 586), which would make all abortions illegal.
H.R. 586 provides a constitutional right to life to embryos at the moment of fertilization. A similar bill in the Senate, S. 231, claims to not target women who use birth control, women who suffer from miscarriages, or families that want to conceive using vitro fertilization, but the House bill contains no such exceptions. When asked by a constituent during a town hall in Savannah whether he had concerns about restricting access to birth control when rape is so common on college campuses, Carter replied, "I'm not going to vote for any bill that endorses abortion." H.R. 586, which would ban abortion, contains no exceptions for the life or health of the mother or cases of rape or incest.


=== Education ===
When asked during a February 2017 town hall in Savannah whether religious doctrine should be taught in public school science classes, Carter responded, "I have always thought we should teach the Bible in school."


=== LGBT rights ===
Carter has said that same-sex marriage should be illegal.
During an August 2017 town hall in Brunswick, Carter said he supported a ban on transgender people serving in the military, saying, "I don't want 'em serving in the military. I'm sorry."


=== Gun rights ===
Carter is a strong supporter of gun rights, and has an "A" rating from the NRA Political Victory Fund for his stances on gun issues.
In February 2018, during a town hall in Hinesville, when asked about mass shootings in America, Carter told attendees to not look to Congress for answers about gun violence, saying Congress is not responsible for gun violence in America.


=== Texas v. Pennsylvania ===
In December 2020, Carter was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a statement that called signing the amicus brief an act of "election subversion."


=== Israel ===
Carter voted to provide Israel with support following 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==

Richard Dean McCormick (born October 7, 1968) is an American physician and politician. A member of the Republican Party, he has represented Georgia in the United States House of Representatives since 2023. Until 2025, he represented the 6th congressional district, the wealthiest in Georgia. In 2024, he was elected to represent the 7th congressional district.


== Education and military service ==
McCormick was born in Las Vegas in 1968 and graduated from Central Catholic High School in Portland, Oregon, in 1986. He earned a Bachelor of Science from Oregon State University in 1990. He earned his Master of Business Administration from National University in 1999 and his Doctor of Medicine at Morehouse School of Medicine in 2010.
McCormick served in the United States Marine Corps and United States Navy for over 20 years, spending time in Africa, South Korea, Afghanistan, and the Persian Gulf. In the Marine Corps, he was a Naval Aviator and helicopter pilot; in the Navy, he was a Medical Corps officer and reached the rank of commander. He is an emergency physician and works at Gwinnett Medical Center.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===
With Rob Woodall not running for reelection to the United States House of Representatives for Georgia's 7th congressional district in the 2020 elections, McCormick announced his candidacy. He won the primary election, receiving more than 50% of the vote, avoiding a runoff election. McCormick lost the general election to Democrat Carolyn Bourdeaux.
Following redistricting due to the 2020 U.S. census, McCormick announced his candidacy in the 2022 elections for the newly-redrawn Georgia's 6th congressional district, which became much more Republican-leaning. In a Republican primary with nine candidates, McCormick and Jake Evans advanced to a primary runoff. He defeated Evans in the runoff and won the November 8 general election against Democrat Bob Christian.


=== Tenure ===
McCormick was among the 71 Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 in the House.
On November 7, McCormick's H.Res. 845 censured Rashida Tlaib for "promoting false narratives regarding the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel and for calling for the destruction of the state of Israel".
In December 2023, fellow Georgia Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene accused McCormick of grabbing her by the shoulders and shaking her, following a public spat between the two. She asked Speaker of the House Mike Johnson to investigate her claims. McCormick said he apologized for the interaction and despite an investigation by the Speaker of the House including a review of surveillance footage and dozens of witnesses, her allegations could not be corroborated.
Following the 2024 New Hampshire Republican primary in January, McCormick endorsed Donald Trump's 2024 presidential campaign, writing, "I am calling on my fellow conservatives to join me in uniting behind Donald Trump for president." McCormick had previously supported Ron DeSantis's presidential bid. During an October 2024 rally for Trump's campaign at McCamish Pavilion in Atlanta, McCormick said that Trump should be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Speaking to Maria Bartiromo on Mornings with Maria in December 2024, McCormick said non-discretionary federal spending should be cut, explaining that:

We're going to have to have some hard decisions. We got to bring the Democrats in to talk about Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare. There's hundreds of billions of dollars to be saved, and we know how to do it, we just have to have the stomach to actually take those challenges on.
In January 2025, McCormick cosponsored fellow GOP House member Eric Burlison's bill recognizing personhood as starting at conception.
McCormick criticized having "a blanket rule that gives all kids lunches in high school", as the high schoolers "are capable of going out and actually getting a job and doing something that makes them have value", such as "going to work at Burger King, McDonald's, during the summer".

He made headlines for walking more than 1,000 miles around the state in his "Walk of Georgia", introducing a bill to abolish tolls on Georgia 400 and leading the charge in pressuring Georgia State Attorney General Thurbert Baker to file suit against the federal government over the Affordable Care Act. In April 2010, Scott withdrew from the race for governor to run for Congress.
In 2010, Scott signed a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity promising to vote against any global warming legislation that would raise taxes.


==== 2012 ====
During his first term, Scott represented a fairly compact district in the center of the state, from Macon to Moultrie.
Redistricting after the 2010 census made the 8th somewhat more secure for Scott. Notably, a large chunk of the district's black residents were drawn into the neighboring 2nd district. This included most of Macon and surrounding Bibb County (except for a sliver in the north); Macon had been the heart of the 8th and its predecessors for more than a century. To make up for the loss of population, the General Assembly pushed the 8th all the way to the Florida border, adding Thomasville and most of Valdosta from the old 2nd. The old 8th already had a significant Republican lean, with a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+10. The new 8th had a CPVI of R+15, making it the 11th most Republican district in the Eastern Time Zone and one of the most Republican districts in the country.
Scott was unopposed in both the primary and general elections.


==== 2014 ====
Scott was unopposed for a third term.


==== 2016 ====
In 2016, Scott faced a Democratic opponent for the first time since his initial run for the seat, private investigator James Neal Harris. Scott defeated Harris with 67.6% of the vote, carrying every county in the district.


==== 2018 ====
Scott was unopposed for a fifth term.


==== 2020 ====
On June 9, Scott defeated his Republican primary opponents, Vance Dean and Danny Ellyson, with 89.81% of the vote. For only the second time since his initial run for the seat, he faced a Democratic challenger, Lindsay Holliday. Scott defeated Holliday with 64.52% of the vote in the November 3 general election.


==== 2022 ====
In 2022, Scott faced Democrat Darrius Butler and won with 68.58% of the vote.


==== 2024 ====
In 2024, Scott again faced Democrat Darrius Butler and won with 68.92% of the vote.


=== Tenure ===

Scott was selected by his colleagues as freshman class president for the 112th Congress.


==== National security and defense ====
Scott's district is home to two United States Air Force bases: Moody Air Force Base and Robins Air Force Base. As a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee, Scott supports pro-military and defense spending policies. He is also a proponent of the United States Navy hospital ships.
Scott was very vocal on the United States Air Force's decision not to replace the Northrop Grumman E-8 Joint STARS, which provide intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities. Many JSTARS are based at Robins Air Force Base in Warner Robins, Georgia. While Scott supports the forthcoming Advanced Battle Management System, or ABMS, he contends the Air Force should maintain the capabilities of the JSTARS until the new ABMS systems are in place. In 2018, the Air Force announced that Robins Air Force Base would host the initial elements of the Advanced Battle Management System, a capability which will fuse global air and space intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance information.
Scott opposed canceling the F-22.
As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, Scott works toward combating transnational criminal organizations and the international flow of drugs.
Scott served on the Conference Committees for the Fiscal Year 2018, Fiscal Year 2019, and Fiscal Year 2021 National Defense Authorization Acts.
For the 117th Congress, Scott is the only member from Georgia to serve on a Congressional defense committee.


==== Agriculture ====
Scott served on the Conference Committees for both the 2014 and 2018 Farm Bills.
Scott secured provisions in the 2018 Farm Bill to bring broadband investments to rural America.
In August 2020, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer held two virtual hearings to examine foreign trade policies harming American growers of seasonal and perishable produce, including one with Georgia producers. These hearings were the result of years of requests by Scott and other members of Georgia's and Florida's Congressional delegations to examine the dumping of foreign-subsidized fresh fruits and vegetables into U.S. agricultural markets below the cost of production domestically.
Scott unsuccessfully ran against Representatives Rick Crawford and Glenn Thompson for Ranking Member of the House Agriculture Committee for the 117th Congress. Thompson, senior to Scott on the committee, was named Ranking Member by the House Republican Steering Committee in December 2020.


==== Legislation ====
On June 15, 2018, President Donald Trump signed into law the Veterans Cemetery Benefit Correction Act (Public Law No: 115-184), a bill authored by Scott and supported in the United States Senate by Johnny Isakson to require the Department of the Interior to provide outer burial receptacles for veterans' remains buried in a national cemetery administered by the National Park Service.
Scott and Representative Sanford Bishop brokered federal assistance for farmers affected by 2018 and 2019 natural disasters, including $3 billion in agricultural relief for damages from storms and reprogrammed unused funds to be used for future relief efforts. This was included in a disaster assistance package Trump signed into law in June 2019.
As a member of the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus, Scott has sponsored and supported numerous sportsmen's and conservation bills. In the 115th Congress, he introduced legislation to modernize the Pittman–Robertson Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act to allow state fish and wildlife agencies to use Pittman-Robertson funds for public relations and for constructing, operating, and maintaining public ranges, which passed the House during the 115th Congress.
On June 11, 2024, Scott voted (at 6:36 in video) against including H.R.1282 - MAJ Richard Star Act in the FY 25 NDAA.  This despite the fact that he is listed as a co-sponsor of the bill.


=== Speakership election ===
Scott announced his bid for the October 2023 speakership election on October 13, facing Jim Jordan of Ohio.
He was considered a close ally of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise who had previously run for the position but withdrew after failing to consolidate the necessary votes.
He was ultimately defeated, with Scott garnering 81 votes to Jordan's 124. He subsequently endorsed Jordan for the speakership.
On October 20, Scott announced a second bid seeking the Republican nomination following Jim Jordan's failure to be elected speaker after three ballots on the House floor and to secure the party's nomination a third time subsequently.

Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated incumbent Donald Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.


=== 2021 Electoral College vote ===
On January 7, 2021, Scott did not object to the Electoral College certification in the House of Representatives. On January 5, 2021, he joined several Republican colleagues in sending a letter to Congressional leadership stating that members of Congress did not have the authority to object to Electoral College votes sent to them by each state absent an investigation from a state legislature or a conflicting slate of electors.

Andrew Scott Clyde (born November 22, 1963) is an American politician and gun store owner serving since 2021 as U.S. representative from Georgia's 9th congressional district. A Republican, his district serves a large swath of exurban and rural territory northeast of Atlanta, including Gainesville, Toccoa, Hartwell and Dahlonega.
In 2020, Clyde ran to represent Georgia's 9th congressional district. That same year, he sued Athens, Georgia, over its shelter-in-place COVID-19 restrictions. As a representative, Clyde voted against certifying Arizona's and Pennsylvania's 2020 U.S. presidential election results. He described the 2021 United States Capitol attack as "no insurrection" and said it resembled a "normal tourist visit", although he previously acknowledged that he had helped to barricade the House chamber "from the mob who tried to enter."


== Early life and education ==
Clyde was born on November 22, 1963, in Walkerton, Ontario, Canada, to American parents. He grew up in Indiana and New York. He attended and graduated cum laude from Bethel University with a BBA in accounting and business management, and was commissioned as an officer in the United States Navy through the University of Notre Dame's NROTC program in 1985. He served 28 years in naval aviation units and the Seabees, including three combat deployments to Iraq and Kuwait.
Clyde received the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, Meritorious Service Medal, a Navy Achievement Medal, and four Navy Commendation Medals. He retired with the rank of commander in 2013. In 1994 he settled in Athens, Georgia, where he had taught at the Navy Supply Corps School. Clyde earned a Master of Business Administration in corporate finance and entrepreneurship from the University of Georgia Terry College of Business in 1999.


== Career ==
Clyde opened a gun shop, Clyde Armory, Inc., which began as a hobby business in his garage in 1991. He obtained commercial real estate in 1999 and moved in 2010 to a custom-built 12,400-square-foot (1,150 m2) edifice based on the design of a historic armory. In 2014, Clyde opened a second location in Warner Robins, Georgia. He grew the business to $12 million in annual sales and 25 employees. In 2013, he was subject to a civil asset forfeiture of $940,000 by the Internal Revenue Service. The action was later reversed, and he obtained a refund of $900,000.
After the forfeiture, Clyde advocated reform of the procedure in testimony before the United States House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Oversight. In 2019, Congress passed and President Donald Trump signed the Taxpayer First Act (H.R. 3151), which includes the Clyde-Hirsch-Sowers RESPECT Act. The law limits what funds the government can seize.
Clyde was a member of the board of directors of Clarke Community Federal Credit Union.
In 2013 he donated a 5,000-square-foot (460 m2) facility to Mercy Health Center and Athens Crisis Pregnancy Center, a nonprofit organization.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 2020 ====

Clyde announced his candidacy for the United States House of Representatives for Georgia's 9th congressional district after five-term incumbent Doug Collins decided not to seek reelection to run for the United States Senate. During the campaign, he sued the city of Athens, Georgia, over a shelter-in-place order imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic that he said compelled his business to close.
Clyde finished second in the nine-way Republican primary behind State Representative Matt Gurtler in a runoff election. The 9th is one of the most Republican districts in the nation, and it was understood whoever won the runoff would be heavily favored to be the district's next congressman. Clyde won the August 11 runoff.
Clyde defeated Democratic nominee and former U.S. Army warrant officer Devin Pandy in the November general election, and assumed office on January 3, 2021.


=== Tenure ===
On January 6, 2021, during the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count, Clyde was one of 120 Republican representatives who voted against certifying the 2020 presidential election results in both Arizona and Pennsylvania. On March 17, 2021, he also was one of 12 House Republicans to vote against HR 1085 to award three Congressional Gold Medals to the United States police who protected the U.S. Capitol during the 2021 United States Capitol attack. In June 2021, Clyde and 20 other House Republicans voted against a similar resolution.
In May 2021, during a House Oversight Committee hearing, Clyde said that the Capitol attack was "no insurrection" and that there was video of the event that resembled a "normal tourist visit", with Trump supporters behaving "in an orderly fashion, staying between the stanchions and ropes taking videos and pictures". During that same hearing, Clyde acknowledged that during the attack, he "helped barricade the [House chamber] door until almost 3 p.m. from the mob who tried to enter". Fellow lawmakers Adam Kinzinger and Eric Swalwell criticized him for later refusing to shake the hand of a police officer who had been beaten unconscious during the attack.
In June 2021, Clyde was among 14 House Republicans who voted against legislation to establish June 19, or Juneteenth, as a federal holiday. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that Clyde "supported the holiday but didn't like its title, Juneteenth National Independence Day".
On February 28, 2022, Clyde was one of three representatives to vote against the Emmett Till Antilynching Act, which made lynching a federal hate crime.
In April 2022, he led a Republican effort to block the naming of a federal building in Florida after Joseph W. Hatchett, the first Black State Supreme Court judge in Florida and south of the Mason–Dixon line. Clyde justified the action, saying that Hatchett had ruled to block prayer at public schools. Naming of federal buildings is usually among the more mundane uncontroversial tasks of Congress, and it is usually accomplished without debate or a recorded vote.
On November 3, 2022, Clyde introduced the Expose Biden's Inflation, Deficits, and Economic Neglect (BIDEN) Act.
In February 2023, Clyde co-sponsored a bill to designate the "AR-15-style rifle" the National Gun of the United States.
Clyde was among the 71 Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 in the House.
Clyde voted to provide Israel with support following 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.
On March 5, 2024, Clyde's Standing Against Houthi Aggression Act was favorably reported by the House Foreign Affairs Committee by a bipartisan vote of 34 - 13.
On June 13, 2024, Clyde introduced H.Amdt. 978 "to relocate the Reconciliation Memorial, also known as the Reconciliation Monument, to its original location in Arlington National Cemetery." It was defeated by roll call, 230-192, with the Aye votes being only Republicans while the No votes included 24 Republicans with the rest being Democrats.


==== Veterans Issues ====
The PACT ACT which expanded VA benefits to veterans exposed to toxic chemicals during their military service, received a "nay" from Clyde. Regarding cannabis, despite lobbying from VSOs such as the DAV Clyde also voted against 2022 MORE Act.

== Early life and career ==
Collins graduated from Georgia State University with a bachelor's degree in business. He has operated several businesses, including a trucking company.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 2022 ====

Collins ran to represent Georgia's 10th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives in the 2014 elections, when incumbent Paul Broun was not seeking reelection. Collins finished in second place in the primary election to Jody Hice, advancing to a runoff election. Hice defeated Collins in the runoff.
After Hice announced that he would not seek reelection in the 2022 elections, Collins announced his candidacy. During his campaign, Collins falsely claimed that Joe Biden had stolen the 2020 election. In a campaign ad, Collins, carrying a gun, told the camera, "You count the legal votes that were cast in the state of Georgia? Donald Trump won this state, period." He then proceeds to shoot a voting machine which explodes. This campaign ad would be cited in discussions of Collins' stance on gun control following the 2024 Apalachee High School shooting that occurred in his congressional district.
Collins and Vernon Jones advanced to a runoff election, and Collins defeated Jones in the runoff on June 21. Collins defeated Tabitha Johnson-Green, the Democratic nominee, in the November 8 general election.
After his election, Collins drew attention for hiring Brandon Phillips as his chief of staff. Phillips was arrested in November 2022 on a charge of animal cruelty for kicking a dog, and had previous criminal incidents, including pleading guilty to criminal trespassing and battery for a 2008 incident when he attacked a man and slashed his car's tires, and threw a woman's laptop. In addition to a separate incident of pulling his gun on a woman.

Collins's 10th District is located within Georgia's I-75 Central Corridor.


=== Tenure ===


==== Impeachments ====
On December 13, 2023, Collins voted to formalize the impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden. Collins called for the impeachment and resignation of United States secretary of transportation Pete Buttigieg in 2023.


==== Budget ====
Collins was among the 71 Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 in the House. In December 2023, Collins used a music-themed Mariah Carey display on the floor of the United States House of Representatives titled "All I want for Christmas is 12 appropriations bills".


==== Counternarcotics ====
In December 2023, Collins's H.R. 1734 Testing, Rapid Analysis, and Narcotic Quality (TRANQ) Act passed both the House and the Senate and was sent to the president of the United States to be signed into law. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that Collins was "in line to become the first member of this year’s freshman class to see a bill signed into law."


==== Foreign policy ====
Collins was among 47 Republicans to vote in favor of 2023's H.Con.Res. 21 which directed President Joe Biden to remove U.S. troops from Syria within 180 days.
Collins voted to provide Israel with support following 2023 Hamas attack on Israel. Collins supports the United States selling weapons to Taiwan, but voted against providing military aid to Ukraine during the Russian invasion of Ukraine.


==== Immigration ====
On January 24, 2024, Collins introduced a bill he called the "RAZOR Act" which would ban federal authorities from removing razor wire placed along the border with Mexico by the State of Texas and the Texas National Guard.
After a migrant in New York City was released from jail without bail in February 2024 after allegedly attacking a police officer; Collins suggested the migrant be executed. Collins stated on X that the migrant should be given "a ticket on Pinochet Air for a free helicopter ride back.” Collins's post referenced the Chilean government's killing of dissidents on death flights carried out during the rule of Augusto Pinochet. The migrant Collins had suggested be executed was later cleared of wrongdoing after the Manhattan district attorney's office announced he had been misidentified.
After the murder of Laken Riley, who was a Georgia resident, Collins introduced the Laken Riley Act, which requires U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain undocumented immigrants charged with theft. The Laken Riley Act passed the House of Representatives during the 118th Congress. In January 2025, the Laken Riley Act was passed by both chambers of Congress and was signed into law by President Trump.


==== Abortion ====
In January 2025, Collins cosponsored fellow GOP House member Eric Burlison's bill recognizing personhood as starting at conception.


== Social media ==
Collins frequently posts memes on social media, jokingly declaring that "Press Releases are out, memes are in." In March 2024, Collins replied "Never was a second thought" to an anti-Semitic post on X by user "Garbage Human", who was implicitly disparaging Washington Post journalist Maura Judkis for being Jewish. "Garbage Human" later confirmed they were alluding to Judkis' religion. Esther Panitch, the only Jewish member of the Georgia State Legislature, criticized Collins, saying "It’s one thing to mistakenly respond to an anti-Semitic account. It’s another thing to double down on it and gaslight us like it never happened.” Collins denied his post on X was anti-Semitic, stating he had called Judkis a "garbage human" because she had said the United States was "built on stolen land."
In April 2024, amidst the ongoing pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses, Collins tweeted, "Not sure what y'all are doing up north, but we don't give them the time to encamp. Tazers set to stun!" Collins's post on X/Twitter was accompanied by a one-minute-17-second video clip depicting a series of scenes from the police crackdown on protesters at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, including a scene in which a Black man is seen lying on the ground in handcuffs while a Georgia State Patrol officer applies a taser to his leg and fires it. Other scenes in the video showed police struggling with protesters, protesters in handcuffs seated near an Atlanta Police prisoner transport van, and footage where the sound of police firing rubber bullets can be heard. In May 2024, Collins approvingly shared footage of counter-protesters at the University of Mississippi heckling pro-Palestinian protesters. Collins praised the counter-protesters, posting “Ole Miss taking care of business." The footage showed a white student engaging in racist mockery of a pro-Palestinian black student by imitating a monkey. The video also showed the counter-protesters chanting "Lock her up!" at the pro-Palestinian student.
In May 2024, citing an article in which it was revealed that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed that a worm entered his brain, ate a portion of it, and died, Collins tweeted: "You either die a Kennedy with a hole in the brain or live long enough to become a Kennedy with a hole in the brain."
In July 2024, after Donald Trump was injured in an assassination attempt at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, Collins stated on his X account, without evidence, that Trump's 2024 United States presidential election opponent Joe Biden "sent the orders" for the shooting and that Butler County's district attorney "should immediately file charges against [Biden] for inciting an assassination."
On October 2, 2024, the day after the vice presidential debate, Collins posted an altered chiseled image of JD Vance.
In January 2025, Collins posted on X that Reverend Mariann Edgar Budde should be deported after the US-born bishop delivered a homily at the post-inaugural interfaith prayer service at National Cathedral calling for newly inaugurated President Trump, who was present at the service, to show mercy to immigrants and LGBTQ children.

Barry Dean Loudermilk ( LOW-dər-MILK; born December 22, 1963) is an American politician from the state of Georgia who has been the United States House representative from Georgia's 11th congressional district since 2015. Prior to this, Loudermilk served in the Georgia House of Representatives (2005–2010) and the Georgia Senate (2011–2013). He stepped down from the Georgia Senate to run for Phil Gingrey's congressional seat in the 11th district; Gingrey ran for a U.S. Senate seat. 
Loudermilk won the Republican nomination for the House seat in a 2014 runoff against Bob Barr. In that race, The Almanac of American Politics stated Loudermilk took a "sharp anti-establishment turn." After a couple years of being in the U.S. House of Representatives, Loudermilk dropped his membership in the "anti-leadership" Freedom Caucus and became increasingly involved in the "more leadership oriented Republican Study Committee." 
Georgia's 11th congressional district is located northwest of Atlanta and is Republican-favoring. The Almanac has stated that a Democrat with a strong base in populous Cobb County could result in a competitive race. From 2014 to present, Loudermilk has been re-elected to successive biennial terms.


== Early career ==
Loudermilk enlisted in the United States Air Force in 1984, where he worked as a communications operations specialist. While in the Air Force, he attended the Community College of the Air Force to earn his Associate of Applied Science in telecommunications technology in 1987 before going on to earn his Bachelor of Science in occupational education and information systems technology from Wayland Baptist University in 1992. He was honorably discharged from the Air Force in 1992. After his military service he founded a company called Innovative Network Systems, Inc.


== Georgia politics ==
Loudermilk was elected chairman of the Bartow County Republican party in 2001, serving until 2004. He served in the Georgia House of Representatives from 2005 until 2010 and was a member of the Georgia State Senate from 2011 to 2013. As a representative, in 2007 he argued for the abolition of red-light cameras because the cameras do not conduct an "investigation", as officers do, to see who was driving the vehicle. Instead, cameras cite the vehicle, and it is up to an individual to prove their innocence. As a senator, Loudermilk supported a ban on undocumented students from attending the top 5 public state universities, and he argued to expand the ban to include all state colleges. Loudermilk resigned from the state senate in August 2013 to focus on a US congressional bid. The bid was for the house seat of Phil Gingrey, who ran for a U.S. Senate seat.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==
In the 2014 Republican primary for Georgia's 11th district, Loudermilk took a "sharp anti establishment turn" and argued that Bob Barr's experience in Washington was a drawback. Loudermilk was described as being the favorite of local tea party groups and having the support of Washington-based figures with a history of endorsing anti-establishment conservative politicians. Barr's surrogates argued that Loudermilk consistently embellished his military record. 
Greg Bluestein, writing in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, said that in the Air Force, Loudermilk rose "to the rank of staff sergeant, the candidate has told us. While in campaign speeches he speaks of his experience as an 'aviator,' Loudermilk says his flying experience has been as a civilian. He obtained a pilot’s license in 2008. And that picture of Loudermilk in an Air Force jumpsuit in a small plane? He was a spotter for search-and-rescue missions." In response to press requests and Barr's surrogates, Loudermilk released a military resume and his discharge paperwork. 
In the primary, Loudermilk topped Barr and won easily against him in the runoff. Loudermilk ran unopposed in the November election. Once in office that November, he cast a "principled vote" (one of only three) against John Boehner as Speaker of the House, which he thought likely cost him a desired committee assignment. The Almanac of American Politics wrote that "after this initial dustup, Loudermilk moved closer to Republican leaders, despite criticism from right-wing talk radio hosts. In 2017, he dropped his membership in the anti leadership Freedom Caucus, citing a lack of time, while increasing his activity with the more leadership oriented Republican Study Committee."
As of December 2024, Loudermilk was serving as chairman of the House Administration Subcommittee on Oversight. In this position, he "spearheaded" a report targeting Liz Cheney over her role in the January 6th Committee. In January 2025, Loudermilk became the chair of a House Judiciary Committee subcommittee formed by Speaker Johnson that was intended to cast doubt on the work of the January 6th Committee.


=== District ===

The lines of the 11th Congressional district of Georgia were last updated as of January 3rd, 2025, after a court-ordered redrawing. The district is located to the northwest of Atlanta. As of 2025, the 11th district includes Marietta, the largest city and county seat of populous Cobb County; cities along the I-575 corridor including Woodstock, Holly Springs, and Canton (the county seat of Cherokee County); parts of Acworth and Kennesaw; and other cities along I-75 north of Atlanta including Emerson, Cartersville (the county seat of Bartow County), Adairsville, and Calhoun (the county seat of Gordon County). The district is Republican-favoring. Given district lines before the 2025 redraw, The Almanac of American Politics said that "recent results suggest that a Democrat with a strong base in Cobb County could give Loudermilk a serious run," given its large population base.


=== Tenure ===
In the 114th congress, Loudermilk had an 84% score from conservative political advocacy group Heritage Action for his voting record, with the average House Republican scoring 63%.
In February 2017, Loudermilk co-sponsored H.R. 861, which would eliminate the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency by 2018.
As mentioned above, Loudermilk is a former member of the Freedom Caucus and has been endorsed by the evangelical author and political activist for Christian nationalist causes, David Barton. 


=== Committee assignments ===
For the 118th Congress:

Committee on Financial Services
Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Monetary Policy
Subcommittee on National Security, Illicit Finance and International Financial Institutions
Committee on House Administration
Subcommittee on Elections
Subcommittee on Oversight (Chair)


=== Caucus memberships ===
Republican Study Committee
U.S.–Japan Caucus
Congressional Coalition on Adoption


=== Allegations of aiding the January 6 United States Capitol attack ===
On May 19, 2022, the United States House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack requested that Loudermilk appear for an interview about a tour he led of the United States Capitol Complex on January 5, 2021, the day before the 2021 United States Capitol attack. House Democrats had suggested Loudermilk aided in the attack, which he and House Republicans disputed. In June, Capitol police concluded that there was nothing suspicious about Loudermilk's tour. Capitol police chief Tom Manger said, "There is no evidence that Rep. Loudermilk entered the U.S. Capitol with this group on January 5, 2021." The next day, the committee released video of Loudermilk leading the tour of the Capitol complex on January 5 in areas "not typically of interest to tourists, including hallways, staircases, and security checkpoints"; the footage showed the group walking through tunnels underneath the Capitol, but not within the main building. A man in the tour group can also be seen taking photos of hallways. The committee then shared footage claiming the man was at the riot, showing footage of a man at the storming of the Capitol the next day.
Loudermilk filed an ethics complaint against Representative Mikie Sherrill and other members for alleging he gave a reconnaissance tour of the Capitol on January 5.


== Political positions ==


=== Health care ===
Loudermilk supports reforming Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security. He wants to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act ("Obamacare"). He compared the 2017 Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare to the American Revolutionary War and World War II.


=== Donald Trump ===
Loudermilk said he considers the presidency of Donald Trump a "movement" and has praised the concept of "Make America Great Again." He has credited Paul Ryan, rather than Trump, with Republican success in Congress. In 2017, Loudermilk called Ryan a "revolutionary thinker."
In December 2019, Loudermilk likened the impeachment of Trump to the crucifixion of Jesus. In a floor speech, he said, "When Jesus was falsely accused of treason, Pontius Pilate gave Jesus the opportunity to face his accusers... During that sham trial, Pontius Pilate afforded more rights to Jesus than the Democrats have afforded this president in this process", a fact pattern disputed by religious scholarship and rated by PolitiFact as "false."
In December 2020, Loudermilk was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.
On January 7, 2021, Loudermilk and 139 other House Republicans voted against certifying Arizona's and Pennsylvania's electoral votes, despite no evidence of widespread election fraud.


=== Financial and economic issues ===
In 2016, the Club for Growth named Loudermilk a "defender of economic freedom" for his conservative voting record on the economy.
Loudermilk opposes the regulation of buy now, pay later financing.
Loudermilk supports a balanced budget amendment but does not consider it "politically viable."
Loudermilk supports tax reform and voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. He called the act a "big Christmas present" for his constituents, claiming it would reduce the deficit, improve the lives of all Americans, and cause more companies to hire due to increased revenues. He said, "I could understand it if all we were doing was just giving a corporate tax break—you could make that argument. But the bulk of the tax reform is giving middle-income Americans a significant tax cut."
Loudermilk supports dismantling the IRS and establishing a flat tax system.


==== Equifax ====
In September 2017, the Georgia-based credit bureau Equifax revealed a data breach that affected 143 million Americans and was characterized by technology journalists as "very possibly the worst leak of personal info ever to have happened". Four months earlier, Loudermilk, who had received $2,000 in campaign contributions from Equifax as part of an extensive lobbying effort, introduced a bill that would reduce consumer protections in relation to the nation's credit bureaus, including capping potential damages in a class action suit to $500,000 regardless of class size or amount of loss. The bill would also eliminate all punitive damages. After criticism from consumer advocates, Loudermilk agreed to delay consideration of the bill "pending a full and complete investigation into the Equifax breach."


=== Foreign policy ===
Loudermilk argued in 2015 against negotiating the Iran nuclear deal. He cited Benjamin Netanyahu's perspective and argued Iran was a dangerous terrorist state—one that sought regional if not global hegemony. He was a Committee on Homeland Security and task force member for the bipartisan 2015 Final Report of the Task Force on Combating Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel.


=== Abortion ===
Loudermilk is anti-abortion and believes that life starts at conception. He supports the right to life movement and has said, "Life is the ultimate right endowed by God and it is the responsibility of governments to protect that right, not to destroy it."


=== LGBT rights ===
Loudermilk opposes federal legalization of same-sex marriage, believing it should be decided by states. In 2015, Loudermilk condemned the Supreme Court decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, which held that same-sex marriage bans violated the constitution. He has supported the First Amendment Defense Act.


=== Veterans ===
The PACT ACT which expanded VA benefits to veterans exposed to toxic chemicals during their military service, received a "nay" from Loudermilk. Regarding cannabis, despite lobbying from VSOs such as the DAV Loudermilk also voted against 2022 MORE Act.


== Personal life ==
Loudermilk's wife is named Desiree. He has three adult children (Travis, Christiana, and Michael)—who were homeschooled and mostly not vaccinated—and 7 grandchildren as of 2024. Christiana was commended with a 2011 Georgia Senate resolution about her accomplishments in the Civil Air Patrol. Travis, who has worked for Marjorie Taylor Greene, has had 3 children from his relationship with Sarah Redwine. Loudermilk is a Baptist and has spoken of his attendance to Oakland Heights Baptist Church in Cartersville, GA. He was "standing near home plate" when the 2017 Congressional baseball shooting began, in which he was uninjured. In response to the shooting, Loudermilk said his assistants in Georgia were armed.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===

Allen ran in the Republican primary for the 12th district against three other candidates. He advanced to the runoff, but lost to state representative Lee Anderson, 49.7% to 50.3%. Anderson went on to lose the general election to incumbent John Barrow.

Allen ran again in 2014, this time making it to the general election. He defeated Barrow in the November election, a result considered an upset even though the 12th district had been made significantly more Republican by redistricting.

Allen was reelected with 62% of the vote in 2016.

In 2018, after winning the Republican primary with 75.99% of the vote, Allen defeated the Democratic nominee, lawyer and pastor Francys Johnson, with 61% of the vote.

Subcommittee on Innovation, Data, and Commerce


=== Caucuses ===
Republican Study Committee


=== Tenure ===


==== LGBT rights ====
In 2015, Allen cosponsored a resolution to amend the Constitution to ban same-sex marriage. Allen also cosponsored an amendment disagreeing with the Supreme Court ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, which held that same-sex marriage bans violated the constitution.
During a closed-door Republican meeting about an amendment that prohibited discrimination against LGBT workers, Allen read a Bible verse that says of homosexuals, "they which commit such things are worthy of death." He told the assembled Republicans that they were "going to Hell" if they voted for the amendment.
After the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, Allen offered prayers to the families of the victims but did not apologize or retract his past comments.
In 2022, Allen voted against H.R.8404 - the Respect for Marriage Act—which would codify same-sex and interracial marriages.
In October 2023, Allen said he could not support Speaker of the House candidate Tom Emmer on the grounds that Emmer had previously supported a bill that would offer the same federal protections to same-sex couples as heterosexual couples.


==== Texas v. Pennsylvania ====

In December 2020, Allen was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated incumbent Donald Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.


==== Foreign policy ====
In 2019, Allen was one of 60 representatives to vote against condemning President Trump's withdrawal from Syria.
In 2020, Allen voted against the National Defense Authorization Act of 2021, which would prevent the president from withdrawing soldiers from Afghanistan without congressional approval.
Allen voted to provide Israel with support following 2023 Hamas attack on Israel. This is in keeping with his view that any opposition to Israel will provoke a curse from God.


==== STOCK act violations ====
In September 2021, an analysis by Business Insider found that Allen appeared to have violated the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012, or STOCK Act, by failing to list on his 2020 financial disclosure form stock holdings in seven companies, worth up to $140,000, that appeared on his 2019 annual financial disclosure form, as well as being about 15 months late in reporting a stock purchase made by his wife in June 2020.
In June 2024, an analysis by Raw Story found that Allen appeared to have violated the STOCK Act by being as much as six-and-a-half years late in reporting 136 stock and other financial transactions, worth up to $8.5 million, on his 2023 financial disclosure form. In response, a spokesperson for Allen blamed the reporting issues on a compliance firm hired by Allen, and stated that Allen had hired a new compliance firm "to ensure all trades have been properly reported."


== Personal life ==
Allen lives in Augusta, Georgia. A Methodist, he is married to Robin Allen and has four children.

Michael Keith Simpson (born September 8, 1950) is an American politician serving as the U.S. representative for Idaho's 2nd congressional district since 1999. The district covers most of the eastern portion of the state, including Idaho Falls, Pocatello, Sun Valley, Twin Falls and the northern two-thirds of Boise. A member of the Republican Party, Simpson was first elected to public office in 1984, and was elected to the House in the 1998 elections, succeeding Mike Crapo. He served as Speaker of the Idaho House of Representatives from 1992 to 1998.
Generally regarded as a moderate Republican, Simpson supports DACA, work visas for illegal immigrants in farming, and was one of 18 Republicans who voted against Jim Jordan's nomination for Speaker of the House all three times.


== Early life, education and private career ==
Born in Burley, Simpson was raised in Blackfoot, where his father was a dentist. He graduated from Blackfoot High School in 1968, Utah State University in Logan in 1972, and the dental school of Washington University in St. Louis in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1977. Simpson practiced dentistry in Blackfoot until his election to Congress in 1998. He was elected to the Blackfoot City Council in 1980 and to the state legislature in 1984, the first of seven terms. He was the Speaker of the Idaho House before his election to Congress.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 1998 ====
Simpson entered the 1998 campaign for the U.S. House seat vacated by Mike Crapo, who was running for United States Senate. He defeated former Democratic Congressman Richard H. Stallings, who held the seat from 1985 to 1993, in the general election with 52% of the vote. He has never faced another contest that close; Stallings was the last Democrat to win even 40% of the vote.
Simpson did not face serious opposition in 2000, 2002, or 2004. In 2006, Simpson defeated former Democratic state Representative Jim D. Hansen, son of former Republican Congressman Orval H. Hansen, with 61% of the vote.


==== 2008 ====

Simpson defeated two primary challengers with 85.2% of the vote. He defeated Democratic nominee Debbie Holmes with 71% of the vote.
During the 2008 presidential primaries, Simpson was an early supporter of former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney and a member of his Congressional Whip Team.


==== 2010 ====

In the Republican primary, Simpson defeated Chick Heileson of Iona and Russ Mathews of Idaho Falls.
Simpson defeated Democratic nominee Mike Crawford and Independent candidate Brian Schad with 68.8% of the vote.

==== 2024 ====

Simpson won the Republican primary with 54.7%, defeating Scott Cleveland and Sean Higgins. He outspent his two primary opponents 6–1, spending $552,233. Cleveland spent $83,725 and received 35.8% of the vote, while Higgins spent $1,021 and received 9.5% of the vote.


=== Tenure ===
While the Republican Party held the majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, Simpson often served as the Speaker Pro Tempore of the House, particularly during debates on controversial legislation, due to his command of House procedure. Simpson is known to have broken several sounding boards with the gavel while calling the House to order. This inspired him to have a number of sounding boards produced in Idaho, which he presented to then Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert as a joke. When the Republican Party regained control of the House of Representatives in 2010, Simpson began once again to serve frequently as Speaker Pro Tempore.
In the 111th United States Congress Simpson became the Ranking Member on the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee. He also serves as the small state representative on the 33-member House Republican Steering Committee. Known as the "committee of committees", the Steering Committee decides which Republican lawmakers become ranking members on House committees. Simpson replaced Don Young on the committee.
In December 2020, Simpson signed an amicus brief in support of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton's lawsuit seeking to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.


==== Larry Craig scandal ====
On June 11, 2007, U.S. Senator Larry Craig was arrested for indecent behavior in a men's restroom at Minneapolis–St. Paul International Airport; he pleaded guilty to a charge of disorderly conduct in August 2007 and paid $575 in court fines and fees. Simpson was openly considered for an appointment to the Senate if Craig resigned. But Simpson asked Governor Butch Otter to remove his name from consideration, claiming that the Idaho Congressional Delegation would be in a better position if he were to remain in the House and retain his seniority on the House Appropriations Committee.

Simpson criticized Senate leadership treatment of Craig. He said: "If that's how they treat their own, that tells me they're more interested in party than individuals, and the party is made up of individuals. How you treat them says a lot about your party." Simpson demanded that Craig be treated fairly, saying "They have people over there [in the Senate Republican Conference] in far worse trouble that they haven't said a thing about." 


==== 2013 government shutdown ====
In October 2013, Simpson voted to end the United States federal government shutdown of 2013.


==== Health care ====
Affordable Care Act repeal 
Simpson voted for and presided over the vote on the American Health Care Act of 2017, which passed the House on May 4, 2017.
Newborn health
Simpson was an original co-sponsor of the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Reauthorization Act of 2013 (H.R. 1281; 113th Congress), a bill that would amend the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize grant programs and other initiatives to promote expanded screening of newborns and children for heritable disorders. Simpson said: "the bill reflects the realities of reduced budgets Washington, but continues and strengthens the well established system of monitoring and evaluating infant conditions soon after birth. Just one small blood sample from the newborn's foot identifies infants with genetic or other conditions that can be treated quickly and effectively, saving and improving thousands of lives."


==== Energy and water ====
On June 20, 2014, Simpson introduced the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2015 (H.R. 4923; 113th Congress), a bill that would make appropriations for energy and water development and related agencies for FY2015. The bill would appropriate $34 billion, which is $50 million less than these agencies then received. The appropriations for the United States Department of Energy and the United States Army Corps of Engineers are made by this bill.


==== Gun rights ====
Simpson was one of the members of Congress to sign the D.C. v. Heller amicus brief which supported a recognition of the Second Amendment as an individual right.


==== Idaho-focused environmental legislation ====
Simpson's hallmark legislation is the Central Idaho Economic Development and Recreation Act (CIEDRA), which would create 312,000 acres of wilderness in central Idaho, much of which is currently a wilderness study area. He has faced substantial resistance from groups like the Sierra Club, which claim the bill lacks "wilderness values" because it allows for motorized access to certain parts of the wilderness area and some federal land would be transferred to the State of Idaho to promote the economic development of the local community and the recreational use of National Forest land and other public lands in central Idaho. Simpson has also faced opposition from groups that oppose new federal land designations, and wilderness designations particularly, because of restricted access to wilderness areas. In August 2015, a revised version of CIEDRA, the Sawtooth National Recreation Area and Jerry Peak Wilderness Additions Act, passed Congress and was signed by President Obama, creating the Hemingway–Boulders, Jim McClure–Jerry Peak, and White Clouds wilderness areas, which cover a total of 275,665 acres (111,558 ha) of central Idaho.
On March 21, 2014, Simpson introduced the bill To amend the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to maintain or replace certain facilities and structures for commercial recreation services at Smith Gulch in Idaho (H.R. 4283; 113th Congress). The bill would require the United States Secretary of Agriculture to permit private entities to repair or replace certain commercial facilities on United States Forest Service land in Idaho. Simpson said, "this legislation clarifies Congress's intent of the 2004 amendments to the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act which continued the existing use and occupancy of commercial services in this corridor of the Salmon River". The legislation passed the House, but stalled in the Senate.
In February 2021, Simpson announced a "Salmon and Energy" concept intended to restore Snake River salmon while protecting agricultural and energy interests across the Columbia River basin.


==== Judgeship reorganization ====
Simpson has pushed to divide the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, sponsoring bills to that effect in 2007, 2011, 2017, and 2021. None of these bills were successful.


==== Dentistry ====
A dentist himself, Simpson has worked closely with the American Dental Association on issues over the years. This has included co-sponsoring an unsuccessful 2009 bill intended to counter "methmouth" and pushing for better reimbursements and coverage for dental care.


==== Tax reform ====
Simpson voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. After passing the bill, he said he spoke to Idaho farmers, ranchers and businesses who called for a simplified tax code and reform. He said the bill would "create economic growth in the United States by unleashing American small businesses and unburdening middle-class families so they can make better financial decisions with their own money."


==== 2020 election ====
In December 2020, Simpson was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.
In January 2021, Simpson voted to certify both Arizona's and Pennsylvania's results in the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count.
On May 19, 2021, Simpson was one of 35 Republicans to join all Democrats in voting to approve legislation to establish the January 6 commission meant to investigate the attack of the U.S. Capitol.


==== Immigration ====
In 2021, Simpson voted for the Farm Workforce Modernization Act of 2021, which passes work visas for illegal immigrant farm workers.
Simpson voted for the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020, which authorized DHS to nearly double the available H-2B visas for the remainder of FY 2020.
Simpson voted for the Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1158), which effectively prohibits Immigration and Customs Enforcement from cooperating with the Department of Health and Human Services to detain or remove illegal alien sponsors of Unaccompanied Alien Children.

== Political positions ==
Simpson is a Republican who is known to take moderate stances. For example, he has supported the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, voting each year against Republican amendments to strip them of funding. In the past he has opposed earmarks.
Esquire listed Simpson as one of the 10 Best Members of Congress in October 2008. The magazine wrote, "More than any other representative, Simpson lives by the philosophy that democratic representation is a matter of finding not advantageous positions but common ground". The magazine's portrayal of Simpson echoes one of his personal philosophies, which is embodied in Henry Clay's words: "Politics is not about ideological purity or moral self-righteousness. It is about governing, and if a politician cannot compromise he cannot govern effectively." This quotation is framed and hangs in Simpson's Washington D.C. office. Simpson played a key role in the election of John Boehner as House Majority Leader in the 109th United States Congress.


=== Idaho federal judgeships ===
In 2010, Simpson joined congressman Walt Minnick in his effort to secure a third federal judge for Idaho. Simpson said, "The caseload of the Idaho District Court has increased significantly in recent decades resulting in Idaho's district judges carrying a disproportionate share of cases in relation to their colleagues in other states."
As of May 2024, Idaho still has two federal judgeships.


=== Health care ===
Simpson has committed to repealing the Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare), questioning its constitutionality and effectiveness. He was close and loyal to Speaker John Boehner.


=== Tax reform ===
Simpson supports tax reform. When asked about the Grover Norquist pledge to oppose any net increase in taxes, Simpson said, "Well, first, the pledge: I signed that in 1998 when I first ran. I didn't know I was signing a marriage agreement that would last forever."


=== Climate change ===
In a 2019 conference in Boise, Simpson said: "climate change is a reality. It’s not hard to figure out. Go look at your thermometer." In his speech, he tied climate change to the viability of salmon in Idaho lakes and rivers.


=== Energy ===
Simpson is also known as an outspoken proponent of nuclear power, extolling its virtues as an environmentally friendly source of energy with minimal carbon output. His support for nuclear energy plays a significant role in his membership of the United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, which oversees the Idaho National Laboratory, a main site for nuclear and alternative energy research in the United States.


=== Ukraine ===
In 2022, Simpson voted to provide approximately $14 billion to the government of Ukraine.


=== Social issues ===
Simpson supports efforts to make it illegal to desecrate the American flag.


=== Abortion ===
Simpson is anti-abortion. He has a zero rating from NARAL Pro-Choice America and a 100% rating from the National Right to Life Committee for his voting record on abortion. He opposes using federal monies to fund abortions, embryonic stem cell research, restricting the transport of minors over state lines to receive abortions, partial-birth abortions except to save a mother's life and human cloning. He supports cutting federal funding of Planned Parenthood.


=== Cannabis ===
Simpson opposes veterans having access to medical marijuana if recommended by their Veterans Health Administration doctor and if it is legal for medicinal purposes in their state of residence.


=== Big Tech ===
In 2022, Simpson was one of 39 Republicans to vote for the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act of 2021, an antitrust package that would crack down on corporations for anti-competitive behavior.

Mary E. Miller (née Meyer; born August 27, 1959) is an American politician serving as the U.S. representative for Illinois's 15th congressional district since 2021. She serves on the House Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on Education & Labor and the Committee on House Administration. Miller is a member of the Freedom Caucus and has been described as a far-right politician.


== Early life and education ==
Born in Oak Park, Illinois, to Annette (Jesh) and Harvey Meyer, Miller graduated from Naperville Central High School in Naperville, Illinois. She earned a Bachelor of Science in business management and did some graduate coursework in education at Eastern Illinois University, but did not complete a graduate degree.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 2020 ====

Miller announced her candidacy to represent Illinois's 15th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives in the 2020 elections to succeed retiring incumbent John Shimkus. She won the Republican Party nomination, the real contest in Illinois's most Republican district, and won the general election with over 70% of the vote. Miller focused her campaign on providing support to farming and bringing manufacturing back to Illinois.
Miller sided with President Donald Trump's false claims that the 2020 presidential election was compromised by voter fraud, calling it "tainted".


==== 2022 ====

In May 2022, the Washington Examiner criticized Miller for employing Bradley Graven, "a man convicted of soliciting sex with a minor, to assist with her re-election campaign." Graven was also seen driving Miller around, raised money for her campaign, and was reportedly responsible for collecting over half the signatures needed to qualify her for the ballot.
After the 2020 redrawing of the Illinois electoral map, Miller won the June 2022 Republican primary by approximately 14 points against fellow incumbent Rodney Davis, whose more moderate views became a liability in the newly redrawn 15th district. Miller had also been endorsed by Donald Trump; Davis had supported the ultimately unsuccessful formation of a January 6 commission in May 2021. Redistricting left her home in Oakland just outside the district. Members of the House are required only to live in the state they represent.


==== 2024 ====

Miller won the Republican primary election unopposed. She also won the general election unopposed, as there were no  Democratic, independent, or third-party candidates.


=== Tenure ===
On January 6, 2021, when Congress met to formally count the votes of the Electoral College and certify the results of the 2020 presidential election, Miller was one of the members of the House of Representatives who objected to the votes of Arizona and Pennsylvania.


=== Committee assignments ===
For the 118th Congress:

Committee on Agriculture
Subcommittee on Conservation, Research, and Biotechnology
Subcommittee on General Farm Commodities, Risk Management, and Credit
Committee on Education and the Workforce
Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education
Subcommittee on Workforce Protections


=== Caucus memberships ===
Freedom Caucus
Republican Study Committee


== Political positions ==
Miller is a member of the Freedom Caucus and has been described as being on the "far right" of the Republican Party.


=== President Biden and the Biden administration ===
Miller has accused President Joe Biden of having a plan to "flood our country with terrorists, fentanyl, child traffickers, and MS-13 gang members", and also said that "under President Biden's leadership the left has weaponized the federal government to go after the American people. We face an unprecedented assault on the American way of life by the radical left."
Miller has supported efforts to impeach Biden. During the 117th United States Congress, Miller was co-sponsor of four resolutions to impeach Biden.
During the 117th Congress, Miller also co-sponsored resolutions to impeach Attorney General Merrick Garland and Secretary of State Antony Blinken. In the 118th Congress, she has co-sponsored resolutions to impeach Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas and Vice President Kamala Harris.


=== Comment about Hitler ===
On January 5, 2021, two days into her House term, Miller issued a prepared speech to the conservative group Moms for America. She quoted Adolf Hitler, saying: "Each generation has the responsibility to teach and train the next generation. You know, if we win a few elections, we're still going to be losing unless we win the hearts and minds of our children. This is the battle. Hitler was right on one thing: he said, 'Whoever has the youth has the future.'"
A number of groups and politicians condemned the comment, criticized Miller, and urged the Republican party to do likewise. Illinois GOP Chairman Tim Schneider called her language "wrong and disgusting" and urged Miller "to apologize". Public statements were issued by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, Anti-Defamation League (ADL), World Jewish Congress, and multiple lawmakers, including Adam Kinzinger and Illinois governor J. B. Pritzker. U.S. Representative Jan Schakowsky, U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth, and the Illinois legislative Jewish caucus called for Miller's resignation. On January 14, Schakowsky said that she would introduce a measure to censure Miller. ADL Midwest regional director David Goldenberg shared with Miller's office a list of 12 anti-Semitic incidents and 17 instances of white supremacist propaganda in the 15th district in 2019 and 2020 in an effort to make Miller aware of "what was going on in and around her district", he said, including information about extremist activity.
On January 7, Miller's office tweeted that her remarks had been intended to compare alleged youth indoctrination efforts by "left-wing radicals" to those of Hitler, while nonetheless encouraging Republicans to aggressively appeal to the youth as a means to collective power. On January 8, Miller apologized for having quoted Hitler in the message, but accused critics of twisting her words.


=== LGBT rights ===
In March 2021, Miller introduced the Safety and Opportunity for Girls Act, which would ban transgender girls in schools from using bathrooms other than those of their sex assigned at birth.
Miller criticized House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on the Equality Act and same-sex marriage, saying, "She doesn't represent the American people, and Americans need to wake up and realize that the Left does not represent the traditional values of the American people."
Miller voted against the Respect for Marriage Act, which codified parts of Obergefell v. Hodges. She wrote in a Facebook post, "This attacks the traditional family. All of these initiatives are deeply unpopular with the American people, and I will always vote NO against the radical agenda of the Left."

In June 2021, Miller was one of 49 House Republicans to vote to repeal the AUMF against Iraq.
Miller was one of 15 representatives to vote against H.R. 567: Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership Program Act of 2021, which would establish an interagency program to assist countries in North and West Africa to improve immediate and long-term capabilities to counter terrorist threats, and for other purposes.
In 2023, Miller was among 47 Republicans to vote in favor of H.Con.Res. 21, which directed President Joe Biden to remove U.S. troops from Syria within 180 days.


==== Myanmar ====
On March 19, 2021, Miller was one of 14 House Republicans to vote against a measure condemning the Myanmar coup d'état that overwhelmingly passed, for reasons reported to be unclear.


=== Abortion ===
On June 25, 2022, the day after the Supreme Court of the United States issued Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, Miller spoke at a rally with Donald Trump and called the decision a "historic victory for white life". Later that night, her spokesman said that Miller had misread her notes and meant to say "right to life".


=== Immigration ===
Miller sponsored Representative Brian Babin's bill, H.R.140 - Birthright Citizenship Act of 2021, which would eliminate birthright citizenship.
Miller sponsored H.R. 6202, the American Tech Workforce Act of 2021, introduced by Representative Jim Banks. The legislation would establish a wage floor for the high-skill H-1B visa program, thereby significantly reducing employer dependence on the program. The bill would also eliminate the Optional Practical Training program that allows foreign graduates to stay and work in the United States.
In 2023, Miller voted for an amendment that would eliminate funding for immigration and refugee assistance.


=== Religious freedom ===
Miller has called for the return of the role of God in public schools.


=== Family leave ===
Miller introduced and sponsored H.R.1980 - Working Families Flexibility Act of 2021. This bill would cap the accrual of any non-union employee, per year, to 160 hours of compensated time off in lieu of overtime pay (the equivalent of 20 days of working 8 hours a day, or 4 weeks if calculated by a 40-hour work week) and prohibits the interference of employers with regard to forcing an employee to take the compensated time off.


=== Unions ===
Miller sponsored H.R.6579 - Teamwork for Employees and Managers Act of 2022, which would require companies to put workers on the board. This has been described as "company unions".


=== Trade ===
Miller expressed support for then-President Donald Trump's protectionist trade policies, expressing the feeling that farmers were taken advantage of in past trade deals such as NAFTA.


=== Big Tech ===
In 2022, Miller was one of 39 Republicans to vote for the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act of 2022, an antitrust package that would crack down on corporations for anti-competitive behavior.


=== Cannabis ===
In May 2024, Miller proposed an amendment to the US farm bill that would repeal a legal change passed in 2018 that made it easier for US farmers to grow nonintoxicating varieties of cannabis, also known as "hemp," but which also had the effect of allowing products containing cannabinoids such as delta-8 THC derived from hemp to be legally sold in the United States. In a statement, Miller said she was "proud my amendment was included to close the loophole that has allowed drug-infused THC products like Delta-8 to be sold," while the Hemp Roundtable, a lobbying group that represents US hemp farmers, referred to Miller's amendment as "hemp industry-killing."


=== 2024 Republican primary ===
Miller tweeted her endorsement for Trump the night of his campaign launch.


=== Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 ===
Miller was among the 71 Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 in the House.

The United States Army was sending infantry divisions home when Second Lieutenant Baird arrived in Vietnam in 1970. Because of the excess of Infantry officers, he was assigned to the 523rd Transportation Company (Light Truck) at Cha Rang Valley.
The truck companies of the 8th Transportation Group delivered cargo along the most heavily ambushed road in Vietnam, QL19, through the Central Highlands in the northern II Corps Tactical Zone. The 523rd had five 5-ton gun trucks at the time. The Group Commander selected the 523rd as one of the two light truck companies to be deployed north to I Corps Tactical Zone for the upcoming Laotian Incursion, Operation Lam Son 719, in February through April 1971. The 523rd was attached to the 39th Transportation Battalion and stationed at the abandoned Marine Corps base Camp Vandergrift. During the two-and-a-half-month incursion into Laos, the North Vietnamese Army tried to close down the supply route with 23 convoy ambushes. Baird fought in two of the operation's deadliest ambushes and lost his left arm during the convoy ambush on March 12, 1971. He earned a Bronze Star and two Purple Hearts. In 2012, the 523rd Transportation Company was inducted into the Transportation Corps Hall of Fame for its heroism during Operation Lam Son 719.

Mark Alan Messmer (born December 16, 1967) is an American politician who has served as the U.S. representative for Indiana's 8th congressional district since 2025. A member of the Republican Party, he previously represented the 48th district in the Indiana Senate from 2014 to 2024, including as majority leader of the chamber from 2018 to 2022. Messmer is a former member of the Indiana House of Representatives, representing three terms for the 63rd district from November 5, 2008, to November 4, 2014. He previously served on the Holy Family School Board from 2001 to 2004. He served as its president from 2003 to 2004.
Messmer supported the state mandated purchase of syngas through coal gasification technology. Developers of Leucadia National proposed a $2.6 billion syngas plant in Rockport, Indiana. Under the terms of the deal endorsed by Messmer, the state of Indiana would have bought syngas under a 30-year contract and then mandate that utilities within the state pass on any losses from the transaction on to Hoosier customers. Gas from the plant would make up about 17 percent of the state's supply. The deal received criticism due to government intrusion in the energy markets, and for forcing consumers to sign up for risky long-term gas purchases at prices substantially higher than market prices. Questions were also raised due to Leucadia National hiring Mark Lubbers to promote the deal. Lubbers is a former aide and close friend of former governor Mitch Daniels. The project was ultimately panned by the state legislature in 2013.
In 2022, Messmer sponsored a bill that bans the foreign ownership of agricultural land in Indiana. He also sponsored bills in 2022 to provide in-state tuition and drivers licenses to illegal immigrants.
In February 2024, Messmer announced his candidacy for Indiana's 8th congressional district in the 2024 election. He defeated former U.S. Representative John Hostettler in primary by a wide margin of roughly 20 points. He resigned from the Indiana Senate in September 2024 in order to focus on his campaign. Messmer would later go on to defeat his Democratic opponent, Erik Hurt.
Messmer is a Catholic.

Mariannette Jane Miller-Meeks (born September 6, 1955) is an American physician and politician who has served as a U.S. representative from Iowa since 2021. A member of the Republican Party, she represents the state's 1st congressional district. Her district, numbered as the 2nd district in her first term, includes most of Iowa's southeastern quadrant, including Davenport, Bettendorf, Burlington, and Iowa City. Miller-Meeks previously served as the Iowa state senator from the 41st district from 2019 to 2021.
Miller-Meeks ran three unsuccessful campaigns for the U.S. House against Dave Loebsack. When Loebsack retired in 2020, she ran again and defeated Rita Hart by a margin of six votes. She was reelected in 2022 by a margin of nearly seven percentage points, and won a third term in a very close race in 2024. She is generally considered to be a moderate Republican and has supported issues such as immigration and LGBT rights.


== Early life and education ==
Mariannette Jane Miller-Meeks was born in Herlong, California on September 6, 1955. 
A first-generation college student, Miller-Meeks earned a Bachelor of Science in Nursing from Texas Christian University, a Master of Science in education from the University of Southern California, and a Doctor of Medicine from McGovern Medical School.


== Career before politics ==
Miller-Meeks enlisted in the United States Army at the age of 18 and served for 24 years, including as a nurse, physician, and member of the United States Army Reserve. She retired at the rank of lieutenant colonel.
Miller-Meeks operated a private ophthalmology practice in Ottumwa, Iowa, until 2008. She also served as the first female president of the Iowa Medical Society. She was the first woman on the faculty of the University of Iowa's department of ophthalmology and visual sciences, and worked as a representative from Iowa to the American Academy of Ophthalmology. In 2010, Governor Terry Branstad appointed Miller-Meeks director of the Iowa Department of Public Health; she resigned in 2014 to run for Congress.


== Iowa State Senate ==
When Mark Chelgren announced he was not running for reelection, Miller-Meeks ran for Iowa Senate, District 41 in 2018, defeating Democratic nominee Mary Stewart. Miller-Meeks served in the Iowa Senate from 2019 to 2020.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 2008, 2010, 2014 ====

Miller-Meeks was the Republican nominee for Iowa's 2nd congressional district in 2008, 2010, and 2014, losing to Dave Loebsack in all three races.
In her 2014 campaign, Miller-Meeks opposed the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). She also stated her opposition to legalized abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or harm to the mother. She opposed same-sex marriage. She criticized EPA regulation of waterways and coal plants, saying it creates uncertainty for farmers.


==== 2020 ====

Miller-Meeks ran to represent Iowa's 2nd congressional district again in 2020, following Loebsack's retirement. She won the June 2 Republican primary election, defeating former Illinois Congressman Bobby Schilling.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Miller-Meeks said she "practices social distancing, wears a mask in public and sanitizes her hands" but does not support face mask mandates.
Miller-Meeks faced the Democratic nominee, former state senator Rita Hart, in the November general election. After Loebsack announced his retirement, journalists and election forecasters labeled the 2nd congressional district a swing district. Miller-Meeks defeated Hart in the general election by six votes; the Iowa Board of Canvass certified the result.
Hart contested the certified result through a petition with the Committee on House Administration under the 1969 Federal Contested Elections Act, which sets forth procedures for contesting state election results in the House under the Constitution. Hart did not contest the election in Iowa's courts. In her petition, Hart contended, without evidence, that 22 legally cast votes were not counted. Had they been counted, per her petition, she would have won the race by nine votes.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi provisionally seated Miller-Meeks on January 3, 2021, pending adjudication of Hart's petition. The Committee on House Administration reviewed Hart's petition, and Pelosi claimed the House had the authority to expel Miller-Meeks, but on March 31, Hart withdrew her challenge.


==== 2022 ====

After redistricting, Miller-Meeks' district was renumbered as the 1st district, effective with the 2022 elections. Miller-Meeks defeated Democratic nominee Christina Bohannan in the November 2022 general election by 53% to 47%.


==== 2024 ====
In 2024, Miller-Meeks again faced off against Christina Bohannan. The race was extremely close, with Miller-Meeks ahead by 801 votes after the initial count. A recount confirmed that Miller-Meeks had been elected to a third term.


=== Tenure ===
Miller-Meeks, along with all other Senate and House Republicans, voted against the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.
On May 19, 2021, Miller-Meeks was one of 35 Republicans who joined all Democrats in voting to approve legislation to establish the January 6 commission meant to investigate the storming of the U.S. Capitol.
Following the November 2024 elections, Miller-Meeks ran in the internal House Republican Conference elections for secretary (the sixth-highest ranking post in the conference), but was defeated by Erin Houchin of Indiana.


==== Infrastructure ====
In 2020, Miller-Meeks said that an infrastructure bill would be her main priority, suggesting a fuel tax increase to pay for it.
In 2021, Miller-Meeks voted against the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.


==== Immigration ====
On July 21, 2021, Miller-Meeks and Deborah Ross co-sponsored the America's CHILDREN Act. The bill would prevent the children of long-term visa holders who came to the U.S. legally with their parents from having their visas expire the day they turn 21. If they have maintained legal status in the U.S. for 10 years and graduated from an institution of higher education, they are eligible to apply for permanent residency.


==== LGBT rights ====
In 2021, Miller Meeks was one of 29 Republicans to vote to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. This bill expanded legal protections for transgender people, and contained provisions allowing transgender women to use women's shelters and serve time in prisons matching their gender identity rather than by biological sex.
On July 19, 2022, Miller-Meeks and 46 other Republican representatives voted for the Respect for Marriage Act, which codified the right to same-sex marriage in federal law.


==== Antitrust bill ====
In 2022, Meeks was one of 39 Republicans to vote for the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act of 2022, an antitrust package that would crack down on corporations for anti-competitive behavior.

Randall Lee Feenstra (born January 14, 1969) is an American politician and businessman serving as the U.S. representative for Iowa's 4th congressional district. The district covers the state's western border and its northwestern quadrant, including Sioux City, Ames, Council Bluffs, and Marshalltown.
A member of the Republican Party, Feenstra served in the Iowa Senate from the 2nd district from 2009 to 2021. He was the Sioux County treasurer from 2006 to 2008.
Feenstra defeated incumbent Steve King in the primary election for the Republican nomination for Iowa's 4th congressional district in 2020. He defeated Democratic nominee J. D. Scholten in the general election by almost 25 points and was sworn into Congress on January 3, 2021.


== Early life and education ==
Randy Feenstra was born to parents Lee and Eleanor Feenstra on January 14, 1969. He is of Dutch ancestry. Feenstra graduated from Western Christian High School, where he played basketball. He received a bachelor's degree in business communications from Dordt University, then called Dordt College, and his MPA from Iowa State University.


== Local government and Iowa Senate ==
Feenstra began his career as sales manager for the Foreign Candy Company, known for being the first US company to import Warheads, later serving as city administrator of Hull, Iowa for seven years. In 2006, he was elected Sioux County Treasurer, replacing Robert Hagey. Randy Jacobsma replaced Feenstra in a 2008 special election, as Feenstra won his first term in the Iowa Senate that year.
Feenstra was elected to the Iowa State Senate in 2008 with 24,595 votes, running unopposed. He was reelected in 2012, again without opposition. He ran for a third uncontested term in 2016. In the Iowa Senate, Feenstra served on the Capital Projects, Fiscal, Tax Expenditure, Transportation, Ways and Means, and State Government Committee.
While serving in the Iowa Senate, Feenstra worked for ISB Insurance in Hull, operated by Iowa State Bank. In 2017, he joined the faculty of Dordt University, after having taught there in an adjunct capacity since 2011.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 2020 ====

In 2019, Feenstra announced he would challenge incumbent Republican U.S. Representative Steve King in the 2020 Republican primary in Iowa's 4th congressional district. His state senate district includes much of the northwestern portion of the congressional district. King, a nine-term incumbent, has a record of making inflammatory remarks, including support of the term "white nationalist." He had been stripped of his committee seats for asking why "white nationalist" was offensive. Feenstra noted this in announcing his campaign, saying that King's "caustic nature" had left the 4th "without a seat at the table."
Republican Party leadership supported Feenstra in the primary. Feenstra raised more money during the primary than King, and was supported by the United States Chamber of Commerce and National Right to Life Committee. Feenstra's candidacy was also supported by conservative political commentator and radio host Ben Shapiro, who donated and urged his Twitter followers to donate to Feenstra's campaign.
Feenstra won the June 2 primary with 45.7% of the vote to King's 36%. Much of Feenstra's margin came from dominating his state senate district, which he carried with almost 75% of the vote. He defeated J. D. Scholten in the general election by a large margin, winning every county in his district except Story County.


==== 2022 ====
Feenstra ran for reelection in the district for the 2022 elections. He defeated Democrat Ryan Melton and Liberty candidate Bryan Holder by a wide margin. 


==== 2024 ====
In 2024, Feenstra defeated Kevin Virgil in the fourth district's Republican Party primary, and faced Democratic candidate Ryan Melton for a second time in the general election. Feenstra won 74 percent of the vote and a third term in office.

Derek Larkin Schmidt (born January 23, 1968) is an American lawyer and politician serving as the U.S. representative for Kansas's 2nd congressional district since 2025. He previously served as the Kansas Attorney General from 2011 to 2023. A Republican, Schmidt was first elected to office serving in the Kansas Senate, where he represented the 15th district from 2001 to 2011, and served as Agriculture Committee chairman and Senate majority leader. Schmidt became the state attorney general in 2011, after he defeated incumbent Democrat Stephen Six.
Schmidt was the Republican nominee for governor of Kansas in the 2022 election, but lost to incumbent Democrat Laura Kelly.


== Early life and career ==
Schmidt graduated from the University of Kansas with a bachelor's degree in 1990, received a master's degree in international politics from the University of Leicester in England, and received his J.D. degree from the Georgetown University Law Center. Schmidt was then a legislative assistant to Republican U.S. Senator Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas, an assistant Kansas attorney general and special counsel to Governor Bill Graves.


== Kansas State Senate ==
Schmidt was elected to the Kansas Senate in 2000. In 2004, Schmidt was elected the Senate majority leader, holding this post through 2010.
During his time in the Kansas Senate, Schmidt sponsored an unsuccessful proposal to repeal the state's ban on for-profit prisons. Schmidt was a supporter of the highly popular Kansas version of Jessica's Law, but "almost single-handedly killed the final bill by demanding inclusion of a provision allowing private prisons in Kansas" as the town of Yates Center, in Schmidt's district, sought to bring a private prison to the town.
According to OpenSecrets, top contributors to Schmidt's campaigns included the Community Bankers Association, AT&T, the Kansas Association of Realtors, the Kansas Optometric Association, Cox Enterprises, Koch Industries, Monsanto, the Kansas Wine & Spirits Wholesalers Association, the Associated General Contractors of Kansas, Sunflower Electric Power Corporation, and Sprint.


== Kansas Attorney General ==


=== Elections ===
Schmidt was the Republican nominee for Kansas Attorney General, defeating Ralph DeZago in the Republican primary election on August 3, 2010. He won the general election against the incumbent, Democrat Steve Six and took office on January 10, 2011. A key issue in Schmidt's first campaign for attorney general was the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the health care reform law. Six chose not to join 25 other states in challenging the constitutionality of the ACA, while Schmidt pledged to join the lawsuit challenging the law, if elected.
Schmidt won re-election in 2014, defeating Democratic nominee A.J. Kotich, a labor lawyer and former chief attorney for the Kansas Department of Labor.
In 2018, Schmidt defeated Democratic nominee Sarah G. Swain, winning election to a third term.


=== Coronavirus response ===

In April 2020, Democratic governor Laura Kelly instituted orders to restrict the rapid spread of COVID-19 that limited public gatherings to a maximum of ten persons. As this would have applied to Easter Sunday celebrations in churches, the Republican-majority Legislative Coordinating Council reversed her order. Republican Schmidt also opposed Kelly's order, contending that it violated the Kansas Constitution and Kansas law. He issued a memo calling the order likely unconstitutional and urged law enforcement not to enforce it. Of the first eleven loci of contagion in Kansas, three had already been traced to religious gatherings. The Kansas Supreme Court reinstated Kelly's orders on April 11, in expedited proceedings. A week later, in a separate case, U.S. District Judge John W. Broomes in Wichita issued a temporary restraining order blocking enforcement of Kelly's order as to two churches (one in Junction City, the other in Dodge City), where the plaintiffs contended that the restriction violated religious freedom and free speech rights.  That case became moot after Governor Kelly issued a new executive order with less restrictive COVID-19 rules effective on May 4, 2020, under an agreement that allowed the churches to hold larger in-person services but required social distancing. Schmidt and Republican officials acted to countermand the governor's orders concerning wearing masks and social distancing. A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that Kansas counties that had passed mask mandates experienced 500 fewer COVID-19 deaths than would have otherwise been expected in the absence of such restrictions.


=== Obama administration ===


==== Lawsuits challenging Obama administration policies ====
As attorney general, Schmidt joined with other Republican state attorneys general in challenging federal regulatory actions adopted by the Obama administration that Schmidt contended were illegal federal overreach. Schmidt and his colleagues were successful in blocking many of these regulations, particularly those proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency. Kansas challenged Obama-era regulations on the oil and gas industry, including a regulation controlling emissions of the greenhouse gas methane; in 2015, Schmidt also joined Kansas in a suit challenging the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan. In the latter case, the Supreme Court issued in 2016 a stay of implementation in a 5–4 decision along ideological lines.
One of Schmidt's first acts as state attorney general was to add Kansas as a plaintiff to the lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 in Florida v. United States Department of Health and Human Services; in a letter, Schmidt wrote that the ACA's individual mandate would "encroach on the sovereignty of the State of Kansas and on the rights of our citizens." The U.S. Supreme Court, in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius (2012), ultimately upheld most of the ACA as constitutional, while striking down a portion of the law which would have required states to implement Medicaid expansion.
In July 2017, Schmidt joined a group of eight other Republican state attorneys general, led by Ken Paxton of Texas, as well as Idaho Governor Butch Otter, in sending a letter to President Donald Trump saying that they would litigate if Trump did not terminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy that had been put into place by the Obama administration. (One of the signatories, Tennessee Attorney General Herbert H. Slatery III, subsequently reversed his position and urged passage of the DREAM Act.)


=== Same-sex marriage ===
Schmidt defended Kansas in a lawsuit brought by the ACLU, seeking to invalidate Kansas's ban on same-sex marriage and its prohibition of allowing same-sex couples to change the names on state drivers' licenses to reflect their married names, receive spousal health benefits, or file joint state tax returns. In 2014, after the chief district judge of Johnson County (the most populous county in the state) ordered the state to issue licenses to same-sex couples, Schmidt filed a petition in the Kansas Supreme Court and obtained a temporary halt to the issuance of licenses to same-sex couples pending a hearing. However, in November 2014, a federal district judge ordered the state to allow same-sex couples to marry. Schmidt petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to block the order, but the Court denied his request. In 2015, after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry, Schmidt dropped his Kansas Supreme Court case against same-sex marriage.


=== Planned Parenthood ===
In Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri v. Andersen (2018), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit ruled in favor of Planned Parenthood, who challenged the decision of Kansas government officials to terminate Medicaid contracts with the organization. The court of appeals held that "States may not terminate providers from their Medicaid program for any reason they see fit, especially when that reason is unrelated to the provider's competence and the quality of the health care it provides." Schmidt strongly opposed the decision, as well as a similar one made by the Fifth Circuit in the Louisiana case of Gee v. Planned Parenthood of Gulf Coast. Schmidt asked the U.S. Supreme Court to reverse the Tenth Circuit's decision, but in December 2018, the Supreme Court denied his petition for a writ of certiorari. The state paid three East Coast law firms $899,000. One of the firms, Consovoy, McCarthy, Park, a Washington D.C. practice which was also representing President Trump in his efforts to prevent the release of his financial records, received $396,000 from Kansas. The firms were charging between $492 per hour to $750 an hour. Average billing rates for Kansas law firms handling such a case would have been $244 hourly.


=== Marijuana ===

In 2015, Schmidt asked the Kansas Supreme Court to strike down a ballot measure, approved by voters in Wichita, that created a city ordinance reducing marijuana possession enforcement in the city. The measure specifically reduced the penalty for persons over 21 charged with a first marijuana possession offense (moving it from a Class A criminal misdemeanor to a civil infraction carrying a $50 fine). Schmidt asserted that the voter imitative was barred because it conflicted with uniform state law, a claim that the city disputed. The Kansas Supreme Court struck down the city ordinance in 2016; the court did not address Schmidt's argument that the local law conflicted with state law, but rather based its decision on a technical error, ruling that the petitioners' filing of the proposed ordinance with the city clerk was improper.
In January 2018, Schmidt issued an opinion stating that all forms of marijuana, including cannabidiol (CBD oil) are unlawful in Kansas. Later in 2018, the state legislature voted to amend the state-law definition of marijuana to exclude CBD products without THC.
In 2019, Schmidt was one of 17 state attorneys general who did not sign onto a letter from 33 state attorneys general in support of U.S. Representative Ed Perlmutter's Secure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act (H.R. 1595), a bill to allow marijuana-related businesses in states and territories in which marijuana is legal to use the banking system. The bill would facilitate the collection of taxes levied on the $8.3 billion industry, reduce the danger of operating cash-only businesses and more effectively monitor the industry.

==== State Objections Board proceedings about Obama's birth certificate ====

Despite numerous judges across the U.S. having rejected challenges to the natural-born citizenship of Barack Obama, since before he was elected president in 2008, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach persistently demanded proof of citizenship before allowing Obama's name to appear on the 2012 Kansas presidential ballot. In September 2012, while leading the three-person State Objections Board, and supported by its other members, Kansas Secretary of State Jeff Colyer and Schmidt, Kobach requested additional evidence that Obama was actually born in Hawaii. In September 2012, the three heard arguments on a claim from a Manhattan, Kansas resident, Joe Montgomery, who claimed that Obama was not eligible to be president because his father was from Kenya and questioned whether the president had a valid birth certificate. As head of the Board, Kobach requested additional evidence that Obama was actually born in Hawaii. The Board asserted that it lacked sufficient evidence to determine whether Obama was eligible to appear on the Kansas ballot as a candidate in 2012 and that they needed to review Obama's birth certificate and other documents from Hawaii, Arizona, and Mississippi before they could respond to the resident's complaint. The challenge, backed by high-profile conspiracist Orly Taitz, was eventually dropped but showed the continuing presence of the "birther" movement. In an editorial, the Wichita Eagle criticized Kobach for entertaining conspiracy theories that "made Kansas look ridiculous" and criticized Colyer and Schmidt for failing to promptly toss the birther challenge.


==== 2014 U.S. Senate race ====
Schmidt joined forces with Republican Kris Kobach, then-Kansas Secretary of State, in filing a brief in support of a lawsuit seeking to force the Kansas Democratic Party to field a candidate in the 2014 U.S. Senate general election. If the Democrats were forced to field a candidate, it was anticipated to have decreased the chances of independent candidate Greg Orman  (who was supported by Democrats) of defeating incumbent Republican Pat Roberts in the 2014 election. The suit was unanimously rejected by a three-judge panel of the Kansas District Court in Shawnee County.


==== State Objections Board proceedings about Michael Capps ====
Michael Capps filed to run in 2018 for the Kansas House District 97 seat using an address on the south side of Wichita. However, months before the election, Representative Chuck Weber, the incumbent in heavily Republican House District 85, that included part of north Wichita, and also suburbs to the north and northeast withdrew from his re-election run, and gave notice of his resignation, effective July 14, 2018. Then Capps changed his campaign filing, running instead for the District 85 seat, giving a north Wichita address, with a business mailing address of 6505 East Central Avenue, #110. Capps claimed he resided the Governeour street address, though the home was scheduled to be sold at auction on June 27, 2018. Democrats alleged Capps did not actually live at that address. However, the Kansas Objections Board, composed of Republicans Lieutenant Governor Tracey Mann, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach and Schmidt, refused to uphold the complaint. The Sedgwick County Republican Central Committee appointed Capps to fill the remainder of Weber's 85th District term. When a Wichita Eagle reporter went to the home in the wake of October 2019 accusations about a fabricated attack video made by Capps against Wichita mayoral runoff candidate Brandon Whipple, an unidentified young man living there said he was "house sitting" and hadn't seen Capps, "in a while." Marc Bennett, District Attorney of Sedgwick County, petitioned to have Capps removed from office after an investigation of child abuse caused him to be decertified and removed as a Court Appointed Special Advocate. Schmidt answered that he did not possess the authority to remove Capps. as Kansas law limits removal of a state House member to four methods: Election defeat, expulsion by a vote of the Kansas House, expiration of the representative's term of office, or recall election. Schmidt noted state law forbids recall elections in the last two hundred days of a representative's term and since the legislature would not meet before the election, it could not expel Capps. In 2020, Capps lost the Republican primary to Patrick Penn, who received 74.4%, 3,349 votes.


==== Joining challenge to 2020 presidential election results ====
On December 8, 2020, Ken Paxton, the Republican Texas Attorney General, sued the states of Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania (four swing states won by Joe Biden, who defeated President Donald Trump) seeking to overturn the election results. Schmidt, as well as 15 other Republican state attorneys general, joined Texas's suit, Texas v. Pennsylvania, which was filed directly in the U.S. Supreme Court. The suit, supported by Trump and 120 Republican members of Congress, alleged unconstitutional actions in the four states' presidential ballot tallies and repeated claims of election fraud, that remained unsubstantiated, and which had already been rejected by other state and federal courts. In the suit, Paxton asked the Supreme Court to invalidate the states' sixty-two electoral votes, allowing Trump to be declared the winner of a second presidential term. Legal experts, as well as attorney generals from the four states, criticized the suit as meritless and politically motivated. The Supreme Court quickly rejected the suit in an unsigned opinion on December 11. The Wichita Eagle editorial board criticized Schmidt for having "signed our state's name to an embarrassing and baseless lawsuit aimed at overturning the presidential election" and noted that the amicus brief to which Schmidt signed "expanded voting rules in the four targeted states, even though Kansas employs many of the same procedures."


=== Biden administration ===
In March 2021, Schmidt joined 11 other Republican state attorneys general in a lawsuit against the Biden administration, challenging a January 2021 Biden executive order aimed at mitigating climate change and incentivizing green jobs. The order directed federal agencies to consider, in environmental rulemaking, the social cost (economic damages) caused by emissions of greenhouse gases (carbon, methane, and nitrous oxide); revoked the permit for the Keystone XL Pipeline; and temporarily prohibited drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Schmidt claimed that the order would be "job-killing" and alleged that Biden lacked the constitutional authority to implement new rules about greenhouse gases.
Schmidt also joined 20 other Republican state attorneys general in objecting to voting rights legislation passed by the U.S. House, alleging violations of the U.S. Constitution and an intrusion on states' rights to manage elections. The attorneys general vowed to challenge the bill in court, should it become law.
On June 17, in a 7–2 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected an attack on Medicare, ruling that the petitioners lacked standing. Schmidt had once again joined in an action brought by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.


=== Other ===
In 2016, Schmidt created a new Fraud and Abuse Litigation Division to prosecute financial crimes and elder abuse.
In 2017, Schmidt's colleagues elected him to serve a one-year term beginning in 2018 as president of the National Association of Attorneys General (NAAG), an office which rotates on a regional basis.
Schmidt hired Toby Crouse as the Kansas Solicitor General. Crouse left the office after being appointed by Trump to the Kansas federal district court.
Schmidt has given oral argument several times on behalf of the State of Kansas in the United States Supreme Court. Schmidt successfully argued two Supreme Court cases involving the death penalty: Kansas v. Cheever (argued and decided in 2013) and Kansas v. Carr (argued in 2015 and decided in 2016). Schmidt also gave oral argument in the Supreme Court case Kansas v. Garcia (argued 2019 and decided 2020), in which the Court held, 5–4, that the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) does not preempt "Kansas's application of its state identity-theft and fraud statutes to the noncitizens in this case."


== Campaign for Kansas governor ==

In March 2021, Schmidt became the first major Republican candidate to enter the race against incumbent Democrat Laura Kelly for governor of Kansas in the 2022 election cycle. Schmidt named former Kansas Republican Party Chairman Kelly Arnold as his campaign treasurer. A Schmidt-aligned political action committee, Our Way of Life PAC, launched the previous week and announced plans to spend money in a push to unite Republicans around Schmidt. One of Schmidt's opponents in the Republican primary election was former governor Jeff Colyer, but Colyer dropped out of the race for the nomination due to ill health in August 2021, and endorsed Schmidt.
Schmidt said he would "welcome" the support of former president Donald Trump in the race and said he felt Trump's agenda "was very good for Kansas." Schmidt was endorsed by Colyer and Trump, and also by former vice-president Mike Pence and former secretary of state Mike Pompeo.  Several months before Bob Dole died in December 2021, he issued an endorsement of Schmidt for governor, jointly with his fellow former senator Pat Roberts.
Schmidt did not receive the endorsement of three of his former Republican superiors: former governor Bill Graves, former United States Senator Nancy Kassebaum, and former Kansas Attorney General Carla Stovall. They all endorsed Kelly in the race, as Graves and Kassebaum had done four years earlier against a different Republican nominee.  Kelly won the general election.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===

On April 26, 2024, Schmidt announced that he would run for the U.S. House of Representatives in Kansas's 2nd congressional district, seeking to succeed U.S. representative Jake LaTurner, who had announced his retirement a week before.

After U.S. Representative Mike Pompeo resigned to become Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Estes won the special election for the seat and was sworn in on April 25, 2017. He is the dean of Kansas's House delegation.


== Early life and education ==
Estes was born in Topeka, Kansas, and is a fifth-generation Kansan. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in civil engineering and a Master of Business Administration from Tennessee Tech, where he was selected for membership in Omicron Delta Kappa - The National Leadership Honor Society.

=== Kansas State Treasurer ===
Estes ran for Kansas State Treasurer in 2010 against incumbent Democrat Dennis McKinney. Estes was the first statewide elected official from Wichita in two decades. He was reelected in 2014, defeating Carmen Alldritt.
As state treasurer, Estes managed more than $24 billion in public money and he came in under budget by over $600,000. He made it a priority to tell Kansans about unclaimed money, such as funds from forgotten bank accounts. In 2016, Estes said his office had returned $100 million in unclaimed property since 2010.
In the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Estes endorsed Marco Rubio for the Republican nomination in February, before Kansas's presidential caucuses. Estes served in the Electoral College and cast his electoral vote for Donald Trump.

=== Elections ===


==== 2017 special election ====

Mike Pompeo, who represented Kansas's 4th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives, resigned on January 23, 2017, to become Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. On February 9, Estes won the Republican nomination to run in the special election to determine Pompeo's successor. Estes won with 66 of 126 votes in a special nominating convention held at Friends University.
The Democratic nominee in the special election was James Thompson, a Wichita lawyer and veteran. Estes was endorsed by many Republicans, including President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, Senator Ted Cruz, House Speaker Paul Ryan, and Governor Sam Brownback. He was also endorsed by the editorial board of The Wichita Eagle.
The National Republican Congressional Committee contributed $92,000, in part for "inflammatory and false" advertisements supporting Estes, which characterized Thompson as an advocate of taxpayer-funded, late-term abortions, and as an advocate for gender-selection abortion. According to April 10, 2017, fundraising reports, Estes had raised $459,000 to Thompson's $292,000.
Estes won the special election on April 11, 2017, 52.2% to 46%.


==== 2018 regular election ====

In the 2018 election, Estes was challenged in the primary by a candidate with a similar name, Ron M. Estes. This led to a conundrum as to how the candidates should be distinguished on the ballot, with Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach deciding that Ron G. Estes could include the prefix "Rep." on the ballot according to Kansas law, although Ron M. Estes complained that this was unfair. The incumbent won with 81.4% of the vote. In the general election, Estes defeated James Thompson in a rematch with 59.4% of the vote.


=== Tenure ===
Estes was sworn into office on April 25, 2017.
In December 2017, Estes voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. In an op-ed for the Wichita Eagle, he said he was "confident it will make a real difference for families and businesses in Kansas", that it would provide economic and job growth, and that workers would see larger paychecks. Estes says the tax-filing process had been simplified, even though the process remains the same.
In July 2017, Estes received national attention for interrupting Representative Kathleen Rice mid-sentence while she asked a question at a Homeland Security subcommittee hearing. Rice tweeted "Day in the life. Worth noting there are men from both parties who don't act like this" and included a video of the exchange. Estes explained that he was simply trying to follow committee rules after Rice's time was up.

=== Economic issues ===
Estes supports a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution and reducing corporate and some personal income tax rates.


=== Health care ===
During the 2017 special election campaign, Estes said that he believes that the American Health Care Act of 2017 did not go far enough to uproot and eliminate the Affordable Care Act, seeking complete repeal.


=== Texas v. Pennsylvania ===
In December 2020, Estes was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated incumbent Donald Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.

James Richardson Comer Jr. ( KOH-mər; born August 19, 1972) is an American politician from Kentucky who represents the state's 1st congressional district in the United States House of Representatives. A member of the Republican Party, he has served in Congress since 2016, during the 114th United States Congress. He previously served in the Kentucky House of Representatives and also served as the Agriculture Commissioner of Kentucky.
As the chair of the Oversight Committee from 2023, Comer has declined or stopped investigations into former President Donald Trump, while starting an investigation on President Joe Biden and his family. As of August 2024, Comer's investigation has yet to unearth evidence that Joe Biden was directly involved or profited from his family's business activities. After Joe Biden ended his 2024 presidential re-election campaign, Comer began an investigation into the new Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, and also began an investigation into the new Democratic vice-presidential nominee, Governor Tim Walz.
Comer served as Kentucky's agriculture commissioner from 2012 to 2016 and in the Kentucky House of Representatives from 2000 to 2012. He unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for governor of Kentucky in the 2015 election. A year later, he won the Republican nomination for Kentucky's 1st congressional district to succeed Ed Whitfield. On November 8, 2016, Comer won both a full term to the seat for the next Congress and a special election that allowed him to serve the remainder of Whitfield's term.


== Early life and education ==
Comer is a native of Carthage, Tennessee. He grew up in Monroe County, Kentucky, graduating from Monroe County High School, Tompkinsville, Kentucky, in 1990. He received a BS in Agriculture from Western Kentucky University in 1993. In college he served as president of the Kentucky Future Farmers of America. After college, he and his family started James Comer, Jr. Farms, a 2,300 acres (950 ha) farm, and he also co-owns Comer Land & Cattle Co. He served as a director of the South Central Bank for 12 years. Comer served as president of the Monroe County Chamber of Commerce from 1999 to 2000.


== Kentucky politics ==


=== Kentucky House of Representatives ===
In 2000, Comer was elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives at the age of 27 following the retirement of incumbent Billy Polston. Comer defeated Donnie Polston, Billy's wife, for the Republican nomination.


=== Kentucky Commissioner of Agriculture ===

In 2011, Comer ran for agriculture commissioner. The incumbent, Richie Farmer, was term-limited. In the election, Comer was the only Republican to win election to a statewide executive office, and worked with a team of Democratic officials and under a Democratic governor. He had the highest percentage of the vote of any candidate on the ballot, and raised $606,766 to his opponent's $204,287. He took office in January 2012. One of Comer's first actions in office was to team up with Democratic Auditor Adam Edelen to investigate his Republican predecessor's ethics while in office.
That year Comer, became chair of the Kentucky Industrial Hemp Commission, and shortly after taking office, he called the legalization of industrialized hemp his top priority, and was "instrumental in getting the hemp industry up and running", including by founding several pilot programs in an effort to restart Kentucky's industrial hemp industry. He also filed suit against the DEA, which resulted in the DEA allowing hemp seeds to be delivered to Kentucky farmers for the first new crops. Between 2014 and 2015, Kentucky's hemp crops grew from 33 to 1,700 acres. Comer also advocated for national hemp deregulation.
Comer founded the Kentucky Proud Farm to Campus program, and created a mobile science centers program for primary and secondary school students to learn about agricultural sciences.


=== 2015 gubernatorial election ===

On August 2, 2014, during the annual Fancy Farm picnic, Comer announced he would seek the Republican nomination for governor of Kentucky in the 2015 election. His running mate was State Senator Christian McDaniel. At the conclusion of voting in the May 19 election, Comer was 83 votes behind businessman Matt Bevin. The Associated Press, calling the race a "virtual tie", did not call it for either candidate. Comer refused to concede and said he would request a recanvass. The request was filed with the Kentucky Secretary of State's office on May 20, with Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes ordering the recanvass to begin at 9:00 a.m. on May 28. After the recanvass, Grimes announced that Bevin remained 83 votes ahead of Comer. She also said that should Comer want a full recount, it would require a court order from the Franklin Circuit Court. On May 29, Comer announced he would not request a recount and conceded the nomination to Bevin.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 2016 ====

In 2016, Comer entered the Republican primary election for the 1st congressional district of Kentucky against two other competitors. His home in Tompkinsville had long been in the 5th district, but had been drawn into the 1st after the 2010 census. Before the primary, he was endorsed by the NRA Political Victory Fund and the US Chamber of Commerce. He won the primary with 60.6% of the vote; the real contest in this heavily Republican district. Comer was elected to the House with 72.6% of the vote. Since Whitfield had resigned in September, Comer ran in two elections on November 8–a special election for the last two months of Whitfield's 11th term, and a regular election for a full two-year term. Comer won both elections over Democratic nominee Samuel L. Gaskins with over 72% of the vote. He was sworn in soon after the results were certified, giving him two months' more seniority over the rest of the 2017 freshman class.


=== Tenure ===
During his first few months in office, Comer held several town hall meetings, where he discussed the Congress's early platform. He partnered with Murray State University to form the Congressman James Comer Congressional Agriculture Fellowship program, and advocated for agricultural legislation reform. He criticized the regulatory policies of Barack Obama, and supported the early domestic policies and actions of President Donald Trump. Comer is a social conservative on same-sex marriage and abortion, which means he is in opposition to both. He believes the trade embargo on Cuba should be lifted.
Comer voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. After the bill passed, he said: "I am proud to support this critical part of President Trump's pro-growth agenda that will fulfill this promise to the American people who have struggled under the weight of Washington bureaucrats for far too long."
Comer was an original cosponsor of the Hemp Farming Act, which legalized hemp nationwide and removed federal regulations on the crop. The bill was later included in the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 and signed into law by President Trump on December 20, 2018. Comer was a member of the conference committee that negotiated its final version.
At the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Comer and Representative Suzanne Bonamici introduced legislation that would protect access to school lunches for school districts throughout the country that had to close because of the pandemic. The COVID-19 Child Nutrition Response Act allows the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to waive requirements for children to gather at schools for school officials and food service personnel to distribute reimbursable, nutritious meals. It also gives local school officials discretion over substitutions for meal components if supply or procurement is disrupted. When introducing the bill, Comer said, "this bill is a critical step toward ensuring that our students maintain access to the school meals they rely on for their health and well-being". After it cleared the House and Senate, President Trump signed the legislation into law on March 18.
After the 2022 United States House of Representatives election resulted in a House Republican majority, Comer said that the House Oversight Committee's "focus in this next Congress" would be to investigate President Joe Biden, particularly his "relationship with his family's foreign partners and whether he is a president who is compromised or swayed by foreign dollars and influence".
After Comer became chair of the Oversight Committee, he responded in January 2023 to the Joe Biden classified documents incident by calling for visitor logs for Biden's residence, where Biden's lawyers found some classified documents from his vice presidency; the same day, Comer said that he would not call for visitor logs for Trump's residence Mar-a-Lago, where an FBI search found classified documents from Trump's presidency despite Trump's lawyers' claim that no such documents were there. Comer declared he would investigate Biden because Biden "hasn't been investigated", adding: "there have been so many investigations of President Trump. I don't feel like we need to spend a whole lot of time investigating President Trump".
When Comer told Fox TV's Sean Hannity, "You look at how Donald Trump is treated. He had documents in one location behind a locked door," Florida Democratic congressman Jared Moskowitz aired previously publicly widely distributed footage of large quantities boxes of classified and confidential documents in Mar-a-Lago were haphazardly stored in various places including an unlocked bathroom and on a theater stage. In March 2023, Comer confirmed that he had ended a House investigation into Trump's financial dealings, in which Trump's former accounting company, Mazars USA, had been turning over documents as part of a court-supervised settlement; the documents provided information on how foreign governments patronized the Trump International Hotel. Comer said he "didn’t even know who or what Mazars was" and that he was instead investigating "money the Bidens received from China".
When CNN asked Comer in April 2023 whether his investigation had found "anything illegal while [Joe Biden] was actually in office", he replied: "we found a lot that's certainly unethical … We found a lot that should be illegal. The line is blurry as to what is legal and not legal with respect to family influence-peddling." On September 12, 2023, Speaker Kevin McCarthy announced an impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden, and announced that he had chosen Comer to head the inquiry.
Comer discussed the impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden in October 2023, stating that "because we have so many documents, and we can bring these people in for [private] depositions or [public] committee hearings, whichever they choose". After Biden's son Hunter was subpoenaed to testify, Hunter preferred to testify publicly instead of privately, to avoid misrepresentations of the proceedings, stated Hunter's lawyer; Comer responded that the subpoenas for a private deposition were "not mere suggestions open to [Hunter] Biden's interpretation or preference".
In March 2024, Comer declared: "I am preparing criminal referrals as the culmination of my investigation" for the impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden. In June 2024, Comer made criminal referrals of Hunter Biden and James Biden to the Justice Department, over alleged refusal to provide information that that The Hill reported had "limited connection" to Joe Biden. Later that month Comer insisted that "this is an investigation of Joe Biden … This was always about Joe Biden … the next step will be accountability for Joe Biden." In August 2024, The Washington Post reported that Comer's "investigation quietly sputtered out after no evidence or testimony obtained by congressional Republicans showed that the president was a direct participant in or beneficiary of his family’s business dealings … Comer himself also promised multiple criminal referrals against [Joe] Biden that never materialized."
After Joe Biden ended his 2024 presidential re-election campaign and Vice President Kamala Harris became the Democratic Party presidential nominee, Comer in August 2024 announced an investigation into Harris' actions in regard to U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the United States-Mexico border, with Comer declaring that it was "unclear what actions, if any, Vice President Harris has taken to fix the border crisis". Later in August 2024, Comer announced another investigation, this time on the Democratic Party's vice-presidential nominee, Tim Walz, the Governor of Minnesota, as Comer asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation to provide information on Walz in relation to China.

Comer opposes same-sex marriage. He also opposes banning discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, and voted against the Equality Act in 2019. Comer voted against the Respect for Marriage Act in 2022.


=== Foreign policy ===
In June 2021, Comer was one of 49 House Republicans to vote to repeal the AUMF against Iraq.
In 2023, Comer was among 47 Republicans to vote in favor of H.Con.Res. 21 which directed President Joe Biden to remove U.S. troops from Syria within 180 days.

== Electoral history ==


== Personal life ==
Comer is married to Tamara Jo "TJ" Comer and has three children. He was baptized at First Baptist Church of Tompkinsville and is a member of Elkhorn Baptist Church in Midway, Kentucky.


=== Personal finances ===
In 2015, just before Comer started publicly running for Congress, he bought a 50% stake in six acres of Kentucky land for $128,000 from landowner Darren Cleary, a major donor to Comer's political campaigns. In 2017, Comer transferred this stake to a shell company, Farm Team Properties, that Comer owns with his wife.
Comer reported that Farm Team Companies was worth at least $500,000 in 2022, but it was "not clear" if the shell company owned any other assets, reported the Associated Press in 2023. In 2020, Comer was criticized for stock trading ahead of the COVID-19 pandemic-related 2020 stock market crash: Comer reportedly dumped shares in Bank of America and purchased shares of online workplace messaging company Slack.
By 2023, Comer has reported owning around 1,600 acres of land.


=== Abuse allegations ===
On May 5, 2015, Comer was accused of physical and mental abuse by Marilyn Thomas, a woman he dated while attending Western Kentucky University in 1993. He has said he believes the accusation was a political stunt to hinder his gubernatorial campaign.

Steven Brett Guthrie (born February 18, 1964) is an American businessman and politician serving as the U.S. representative for Kentucky's 2nd congressional district since 2009. The district is in central Kentucky and includes Fort Knox, Owensboro, Bowling Green, and a portion of eastern Louisville. Guthrie previously served as a Republican member of the Kentucky Senate.


== Early life, education, and career ==
Guthrie was born in Florence, Alabama, the son of Carolyn P. (née Holt) and Lowell M. Guthrie. He earned his Bachelor of Science in mathematical economics at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1987 and his Master's of Public and Private Management at the Yale School of Management in 1997.
Guthrie is a former vice president of Trace Die Cast, Inc., an automotive parts supplier based in Bowling Green. He previously served as a field artillery officer in the 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky.


== Kentucky Senate ==
Guthrie represented the 32nd district in the Kentucky Senate from 1999 to 2008, serving as vice chair of the Economic Development, Tourism and Labor Committee and chairing the Transportation Committee.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===
2008

In the 2008 congressional general election, Guthrie defeated Democratic nominee State Senator David Boswell for the right to succeed the retiring U.S. Representative Ron Lewis. Lewis announced his retirement on the last day for candidates to file for the seat in 2008, in hopes of steering the Republican nomination to his chief of staff, Daniel London. Guthrie defeated London for the nomination.

This set up the closest race in the 2nd in 14 years. Democrats had a large advantage in registration, but voters had been very conservative on social issues. This was a major reason Lewis had been able to hold the district with little trouble since winning it in a 1994 special election. Guthrie prevailed by 15,500 votes, mostly on the strength of rural voters. He may have been boosted by voters being more motivated to come to the polls due to the presidential and Senate election held at the same time. Republican presidential nominee John McCain carried the district with 60% of the vote and won all but one county entirely within the district. Incumbent Republican Senator Mitch McConnell also carried the 2nd district easily.

2010

The 2nd reverted to form in 2010, and Guthrie defeated Democratic nominee Ed Marksberry by a large margin.

2012

Guthrie won reelection in 2012 with over 64% of the vote.

2018

Guthrie filed for reelection on November 27, 2017. Two Democratic challengers filed against Guthrie: Grant Short and Brian Pedigo, both of whom ultimately lost to Democratic candidate Hank Linderman in the primary.


=== Tenure ===
2011
In 2011, Guthrie voted for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 as part of a controversial provision that allows the government and the military to indefinitely detain American citizens and others without trial. In July 2013, he voted against defunding the National Security Agency due to the alleged privacy violations reported by whistleblower Edward Snowden.

2013
Guthrie voted in favor of ending the 2013 United States federal government shutdown.
In September, Guthrie introduced the Missing Children's Assistance Reauthorization Act of 2013, authorizing the continued funding of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children through fiscal year 2018 and to strengthen additional programs that prevent the abduction and sexual exploitation of children.

2017
Guthrie and Virginia Foxx introduced the Promoting Real Opportunity, Success and Prosperity through Education Reform (PROSPER) Act, an act that would eliminate Public Service Loan Forgiveness and reduce federal funding made available to for-profit colleges.
On December 19, Guthrie voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Before his vote, he said he was "willing to accept" criticism about the bill making American businesses more competitive on a global scale.

2022
In August 2022, Guthrie criticized President Joe Biden for forgiving up to $10,000 of student loan debt for eligible borrowers. Guthrie was criticized for hypocrisy because he had $4.3 million of debt from his PPP loan forgiven.

Garland Hale "Andy" Barr IV (born July 24, 1973) is an American attorney and politician serving as the U.S. representative for Kentucky's 6th congressional district since 2013. A member of the Republican Party, he previously served in the administration of Kentucky Governor Ernie Fletcher.


== Early life and education ==
Barr was born in Lexington, Kentucky, the son of Garland Hale Barr III and Rev. Donna R. (Faulconer) Barr. The Barr family has been in Lexington for generations, and Barr Street in that city is reportedly named for one of Barr's ancestors. His father founded two companies in Lexington, the accounting firm Barr, Anderson and Roberts PLLC, and Merrick Management, Inc, a physician practice firm. His mother is a deacon in the Episcopal Diocese of Lexington.
Barr graduated from Henry Clay High School in Lexington, Kentucky, in 1992. He attended the University of Virginia, where, as a contributor to the conservative campus publication The Virginia Advocate, he was highly critical of then-President Bill Clinton for allegedly evading the draft. While in college, he was also an intern for U.S. Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican National Committee, and the Heritage Foundation. He also was a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon.
Barr graduated magna cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa from UVA in 1996 with a B.A. in government and philosophy. From 1996 until 1998, he worked as a legislative assistant to Jim Talent, then a U.S. Representative from Missouri, where he staffed Talent's service on the Speaker's Health Care Reform Task Force. In 2001, Barr earned a J.D. degree from the University of Kentucky College of Law. He was president of the Federalist Society at UK Law and was chosen to compete on the Moot Court National Team.


== Law career ==
Commencing practice in Lexington, Barr joined the Fayette County Bar Association Young Lawyers Section and co-founded the Lexington Charity Club, a nonprofit organization of young men raising money for charitable causes, with Lee Greer and Rob Lewis. In 2002, he joined the liability defense service group and the business litigation service group at the Lexington law firm Stites & Harbison. While there, he worked for former Democratic Kentucky Attorney General and future Governor of Kentucky Steve Beshear, who urged him to get involved in state politics. Barr and colleague Brad Cowgill were employed by Republican gubernatorial candidate Ernie Fletcher in 2003 to fight charges that Fletcher's running mate, Hunter Bates, did not meet the state's residency requirements for eligibility for the office of lieutenant governor. A judge ruled against Bates, and he was dropped from the ticket.


=== Fletcher administration ===
After Fletcher won the election, Barr was named to the Fletcher's transition team in the Public Protection and Regulation Cabinet. Fletcher chose Barr as general counsel for the governor's office of local development. When Fletcher declared April Child Abuse Prevention Month in Kentucky, Barr wrote Fletcher's speech for the occasion. While researching the speech, he made contact with the nonprofit group Prevent Child Abuse in Kentucky. He became interested in the organization's mission and was elected to its board of directors in 2004; he served as its vice president in 2007 and president in 2008 and 2009.
Fletcher's term in office was marred by a hiring scandal that involved violations of the state merit system. Barr was not implicated in the scandal; he told the Lexington Herald-Leader that Fletcher's Local Initiatives for a New Kentucky (LINK) outreach program, a sub-unit of the office of local development, stopped recruiting and vetting individuals for merit positions in the executive branch after he briefed officials about an opinion issued by the Executive Branch Ethics Commission during the administration of Fletcher's predecessor, Paul E. Patton, regarding acceptable and unacceptable hiring under the merit system. The Herald-Leader later requested copies of any employment recommendations made by LINK employees, but Barr refused the request, citing an exemption in Kentucky's Open Records Act that provides exemptions for "preliminary drafts, notes and correspondence" of state employees.
In 2007, Fletcher's general counsel resigned to become executive director of the Kentucky Bar Association; deputy general counsel David E. Fleenor was elevated to general counsel, and Barr replaced Fleenor as deputy general counsel. In this capacity, he authored a defense of Fletcher's executive order that the Ten Commandments be posted in the rotunda of the state capitol alongside other historical documents. Fletcher was defeated for reelection in 2007 and before his term expired, he named Barr to the state Public Advocacy Commission.


=== Post-Fletcher administration ===
In April 2008, Barr returned to private practice as an associate at the law firm Kinkead and Stilz; he also worked as a part-time instructor of constitutional law at the University of Kentucky. He was chosen as an alternate delegate to the 2008 Republican National Convention and served as vice president of the Fayette County Republican Party.


== U.S House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 2010 ====

On November 10, 2009, Barr became the first Republican to formally announce that he would seek his party's nomination to challenge incumbent 6th district congressman Ben Chandler. In the announcement, he touted his opposition to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (which Chandler had also opposed) and the American Clean Energy and Security Act (which Chandler supported). Barr's campaign raised far more money than those of any of his five opponents in the Republican primary. Barr garnered 31,255 votes in the primary, while his opponents' totals ranged from 4,789 to 1,880.
In an interview with WKYT-TV in July, Barr denounced the recently signed Dodd–Frank Act that enacted new regulations on the banking industry. He called for an end to the practice of politicians earmarking funds for special projects in their districts, a position that put him at odds with state party leaders such as McConnell and long-time 5th district Congressman Hal Rogers. Although he supported strengthening security along the U.S. border with Mexico to curb illegal immigration, he stated his belief that fellow Republican Senate candidate Rand Paul's plan to deny citizenship to U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants violated the Fourteenth Amendment.
The National Republican Congressional Committee targeted Barr's race against Chandler as part of its strategy to gain control of the House of Representatives during the 2010 midterm elections, and Ohio Congressman John Boehner, who stood to become Speaker of the House if the Republicans gained a majority, visited the state to campaign for Barr. Substantial amounts of money from political groups outside the state aided both candidates and spawned a number of negative campaign ads. Chandler aired ads in August alluding to Barr's arrest in Florida for using a fake ID and seeking to tie him to the Fletcher administration's wrongdoing. Barr countered with ads criticizing Chandler's support of cap-and-trade legislation, an unpopular vote in coal-dependent Kentucky, and his vote in favor of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which Barr characterized as a waste of taxpayer money that did little to stimulate an economic recovery.
Unofficial election day results showed Chandler narrowly defeating Barr, but the race was so close that Barr did not concede. When the official results were released, Chandler had received 119,812 (50.1%) votes to Barr's 119,163 (49.8%). Barr petitioned Kentucky Secretary of State Trey Grayson for a recanvass of the voting machines in the district, but this yielded only one additional vote for Barr. On November 12, ten days after the election, Barr announced that he would concede the election to Chandler rather than request a full recount.


==== 2012 ====

On June 9, 2011, Barr announced that he would again challenge Chandler for his seat in the 2012 elections. Chandler responded to the announcement by declaring, "Next year, voters will have a very simple choice to make: whether to protect and save Social Security and Medicare, or to end them," an allusion to Barr's publicly expressed support for Representative Paul Ryan's budget proposal.
In July 2012, Roll Call reported that "a wide swath of influential Republicans in Kentucky see Barr's campaign as something of a lost cause...In the eyes of those who know Kentucky best, from Washington, D.C., to Frankfort, this isn't much of a race right now."

Barr won the Republican primary and again received financial support from the National Republican Campaign Committee in his general election campaign. When Chandler decided not to attend the 2012 Democratic National Convention, Barr charged that he was trying to avoid association with President Barack Obama, who was seeking a second term and was unpopular in Kentucky. A spokesperson for Chandler maintained that Chandler had previous engagements in his home district that week, but that he supported Obama's reelection. Barr was chosen to give a brief address at the 2012 Republican National Convention, during which he decried Obama's perceived hostility toward the coal industry. Chandler campaign staffers criticized Barr's decision to attend the convention, saying that he should spend the time in his district, getting to know the people there better. They also mocked the fact that the backdrop for Barr's speech was a picture of the city of Louisville, which is not in the 6th district; Barr's campaign countered that they had no part in choosing the backdrop.
Both candidates began their TV ad campaigns with more positive ads; Barr's wife appeared in his first ad, touting him as a "family man", while Chandler tried to combat Barr's charges of fiscal liberalism by releasing an ad criticizing excessive government spending. Tea Party-backed Kentucky Senator Rand Paul endorsed Barr despite their differences on some policy matters, including Barr's support for the Patriot Act. The positive tone did not hold as the race tightened. Chandler's campaign attacked Barr for using a mining executive from Morganfield, which is well outside the 6th district, as a coal miner from Estill County, which is in the district. The campaign's charges that the man depicted was "not a miner" prompted him to threaten a suit for defamation, and he produced copies of his certified miner credentials in rebuttal to the charge. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee also bought ads that again raised the issue of Barr's previous conviction and his association with Fletcher.
Barr won the election by a vote of 153,222 (51%) to 141,436 (47%).


==== 2014 ====

Barr defeated Democratic nominee Elisabeth Jensen in the 2014 general election, by a vote of 147,404 (60%) to 98,290 (40%). Barr garnered wide support and raised substantial funds for the race.


==== 2016 ====

In the 2016 congressional elections, Democrat Rev. Nancy Jo Kemper, a graduate of Yale Divinity School and former executive director of the Kentucky Council of Churches, challenged Barr in the 6th Congressional District. She ran with the support of former Lt. Governor Crit Luallen, State Senator Reggie Thomas, State Representative Susan Westrom, and Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes. Barr was reelected with 61.1% of the vote.


==== 2018 ====

Barr won the 2018 Republican primary. Former Marine fighter pilot Amy McGrath defeated Lexington Mayor Jim Gray and state Senator Reggie Thomas for the Democratic nomination. The race was considered potentially competitive by some observers. Barr defeated McGrath in the general election, 51% to 48%.


==== 2020 ====

Barr faced attorney and U.S. Marine veteran Josh Hicks. Barr defeated Hicks in the general election, 57.3% to 41%.
2022

Barr faced Democrat Geoff Young in the general election. Young came under fire for using Kremlin talking points while campaigning, most notably accusing the Ukrainian government of being run by "Nazis" following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Young failed to receive the endorsement of the Kentucky Democratic Party after winning the Democratic primary. Barr won the general election 62.7% to 33.6%.


=== Tenure ===

Barr serves on the House Committee on Financial Services, and was the ranking member of the Subcommittee on National Security, International Development, and Monetary Policy. He also serves on the Republican Study Committee's (RSC) leadership team and chairs the RSC American Worker Task Force (AWTF). The RSC is the largest conservative caucus in Congress.
On July 11, 2013, Barr introduced the CFPB Rural Designation Petition and Correction Act (H.R. 2672; 113th Congress), a bill that would amend the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to direct the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to establish an application process that would allow a person to get their county designated as "rural" for purposes of a federal consumer financial law. One practical effect of having a county designated "rural" is that people can qualify for some types of mortgages by getting them exempted from the CFPB's qualified mortgage rule.
In December 2013, Barr introduced H.R. 3775, the Military Sexual Assault Victims Empowerment Act, commonly called the Military SAVE Act. This bill requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Defense to each operate a program that ensures that veterans and members of the armed forces may receive treatment from private providers for military sexual trauma. He has since reintroduced the bill three times.
On March 6, 2014, Barr introduced the Restoring Proven Financing for American Employers Act (H.R. 4167; 113th Congress), a bill that would "exempt existing collateralized loan obligations from the so-called Volcker Rule, which bars banks from making risky trades with their own money and limits their investments in certain funds." The bill passed the House on April 29, 2014, in a voice vote.
In December 2017, Barr voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. He introduced the Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act, which passed and states that sellers of mobile homes are not loan or mortgage originators and are therefore not subject to the Truth in Lending Act.
Barr has taken part in legislation targeted at the opioid epidemic. In May 2018, he sponsored the CAREER Act, aimed at providing transitional housing for those recovering from opioid addiction. The bill is currently in committee. Barr also helped enact legislation to provide targeted response block grants to states suffering from the opioid epidemic. The grants would provide $500 million in funds for the epidemic up to fiscal year 2021. Barr was also key to the University of Kentucky being awarded $87 million by the Department of Health and Human Services as part of a HEAL (Helping to End Addiction Long-term) grant to provide help to Kentucky communities hit hardest by the opioid epidemic.
In October 2018, Barr played a pivotal role in Camp Nelson being designated as Kentucky's first National Monument by the Department of the Interior.
Barr also introduced the Financial Protections for Our Military Families Act in December 2018. The legislation is designed to extend the supervisory authority of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to credit protections applicable to certain active duty members of the armed forces and their dependents. The bill is currently in committee.
In April 2019, Barr introduced H.R. 2196, an amendment to change the required hours for the Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Scholarship program from 128 to 120. The bill passed and was signed into law by President Donald Trump in July 2019.
In October 2019, the Barr-led AWTF's final report laid out key conservative reforms on labor, welfare, and education policy. These reforms would bolster alternative paths in education, improve work flexibility on compensation and paid-time off for employees nationwide, and to enhance the portability of housing vouchers to allow workers to more easily relocate to pursue job opportunities without giving up their housing assistance.
In April 2020, Barr was one of the first members of Congress to call for an investigation into the origins of COVID-19. He then introduced legislation to create a select committee to investigate the virus's origin. Barr reintroduced the bill in May 2021.
In May 2020, House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy appointed Barr to serve on the House of Representatives China Task Force. The task force was created to provide recommendations to the U.S. to better position itself against the emerging economic, political, military, and technological threat from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Barr was appointed co-chair of the subgroup on Competitiveness along with the subgroup on Economics and Energy.
In September 2020, Barr's Horseracing and Safety Act passed both the Senate and the House. The bill created the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority (HISA) for purposes of developing and implementing a horseracing anti-doping and medication control program and a racetrack safety program to ensure the sport's safety and integrity. The bill sets forth other provisions regarding funding, conflicts of interest, and jurisdiction; registration with the authority; program enforcement; rule violations and civil sanctions; testing laboratories; review of final decisions of the authority by an administrative law judge; unfair or deceptive acts or practices; and agreements with state racing commissions. Barr had been an author and advocate for the bill for over six years on the House side with Mitch McConnell advocating for the bill on the Senate side. In December 2022, Congress approved an amendment to the HISA Act that gave the bill legal grounds to be enacted after court challenges stalled its implementation. This amendment was signed into law on December 29, 2022.
In February 2021, Barr introduced the Cardiovascular Advances in Research and Opportunities Legacy (CAROL) Act. The bill was named in honor of Barr's late wife, Carol, who died in June 2020 of cardiac arrest caused by a ventricular arrhythmia. The bill authorizes a grant program administered by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), supporting research on valvular heart disease and encouraging the use of technological imaging and precision medicine to generate data on people with valvular disease. The bill also directs the NHLBI to conduct a workshop on mitral valve prolapse (MVP) in an effort to develop prescriptive guidelines for treatment of people with MVP. The American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology endorsed the CAROL Act. On December 20, 2022, it was signed into law.
In November 2021, Barr introduced the Equine Tax Fairness Act. This bill modifies the tax treatment of gains and losses from the sale of depreciable property used in a trade or business to eliminate horses from the definition of livestock. This would reduce the holding period for equine assets to be considered long-term capital gains, putting them on a level playing field with other similar assets. The bill also makes permanent the three-year recovery period for the depreciation of racehorses. It has been endorsed by the National Thoroughbred Racing Association, the Kentucky Thoroughbred Association, the Jockey Club, the Thoroughbred Owners and Breeders Association, Keeneland, and the American Horse Council.
In February 2023, Barr introduced H.J. Res 30, which would have disapproved the Department of Labor's final rule titled "Prudence and Loyalty in Selecting Plan Investments and Exercising Shareholder Rights". The bill would have blocked environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing in employer-sponsored retirement plans. On March 20, 2023, after passing the House and the Senate, the bill was vetoed by President Joe Biden, the first veto of Biden's tenure. Biden said he vetoed the bill because it did not "take into consideration investments that would be impacted by climate impacted by overpaying executives".

=== Abortion ===
Barr is anti-abortion. He believes that abortion should be illegal, including in cases of rape and incest, unless the mother's life is threatened. Barr opposes using federal funding to support organizations that offer abortions. In a 2012 interview, he said, "I think the vast majority of people of this country have come to the conclusion that wherever you are on this issue, we shouldn't have taxpayer funding for abortion."


=== LGBT rights ===
In the 114th United States Congress, Barr had a zero score from LGBT rights advocacy organization the Human Rights Campaign. In 2015, he opposed the Supreme Court ruling Obergefell v. Hodges, which held that same-sex marriage bans violate the Constitution.


=== Donald Trump ===
Barr said President Donald Trump's comments in the wake of the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, were filled with "too much ambiguity."
Amid the Trump–Ukraine scandal, where an impeachment inquiry was launched into Trump after he requested that the Ukrainian president investigate 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, Barr defended Trump's actions, characterizing his request of the Ukrainian president as "routine diplomacy".
On December 18, 2019, Barr voted against both articles of impeachment against Trump.
On January 13, 2021, Barr voted against Trump's second impeachment.


=== Environment and energy ===
Of climate change, Barr said in 2019, "Some say the science is settled. That's not true. There are scientists who dispute the level of warming, the extent to which humans are contributing to that." In 2013, Barr said, "Coal does contribute to climate change." Barr opposes a carbon tax.
In 2019, Barr invited Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to his district to hear how the Green New Deal, of which Ocasio-Cortez is a leading proponent, would affect coal miners. Ocasio-Cortez accepted the invitation. Shortly thereafter, Barr withdrew his invitation, citing her "lack of civility" toward Dan Crenshaw. Ocasio-Cortez responded that Barr was waffling.


=== Israel ===
Barr has generally been supportive of Israel, particularly following the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel and the subsequent Israel-Hamas war. In the war's first months, he voted for a motion that declared the House of Representatives' solidarity with Israel and wrote an op-ed for the Lexington Herald-Leader wherein he advocated for Israel's interests over those of Hamas and Palestinian civilians. In 2024, he exhorted Secretary of State Anthony Blinken to not accept the International Criminal Court's finding that Israeli security forces had credibly broken international laws and praised Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address to a joint session of Congress, professing the intertwining of American and Israeli interests and the necessity of the countries working together to "defeat Hamas and other Iranian proxies."


== Electoral history ==


== Personal life ==
In 2008, Barr married Eleanor Carol Leavell of Georgetown, Kentucky, who previously served as the executive director of the Henry Clay Center for Statesmanship. They had two daughters. Barr's wife died unexpectedly on June 16, 2020, at age 39, of natural causes from ventricular arrhythmia caused by a heart condition known as mitral valve prolapse, at the family's home in Lexington.
In April 2023, Barr married Davis Huffman.
Barr is an Episcopalian.

Glen Clay Higgins (born August 24, 1961) is an American politician and reserve law enforcement officer from the state of Louisiana. A Republican, Higgins is the U.S. representative for Louisiana's 3rd congressional district. The district, which contains much of the territory once represented by former governor Edwin Edwards and former U.S. senator John Breaux, is in the southwestern corner of the state and includes Lafayette, Lake Charles, and New Iberia. Higgins won the runoff election on December 10, 2016, defeating fellow Republican Scott Angelle.
As well as being an elected official, Higgins continues to hold a law enforcement commission in a reserve capacity with the Louisiana Attorney General's office.
Higgins has appeared and spoken at events organized by groups such as the Three Percenters and the Oath Keepers, and has claimed to be a "Three Percenter" at speaking engagements. He is a member of the House Freedom Caucus, and his views have been identified as far-right.


== Early life and education ==
Higgins is the seventh of eight children. He was born in New Orleans, and his family moved to Covington, Louisiana, when he was six years old. The family raised and trained horses. After graduation from Covington High School, he attended Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, but did not graduate.


== Career ==
At age 18, Higgins enlisted in the Military Police Corps of the Louisiana National Guard, serving for six years (1979–85) and reaching the rank of staff sergeant. While working as a military officer, Higgins supported the 1992 presidential campaign of Pat Buchanan and the gubernatorial campaign of Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, despite Higgins describing Duke as a "Nazi" to an Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter.
He worked for several years as a manager of car dealerships.


=== Local law enforcement ===
In 2004, Higgins became a patrol officer for the Opelousas City police department. By 2007, police chief Perry Gallow was prepared to take major disciplinary action against Higgins. In a letter to the city council, he wrote, "Clay Higgins used unnecessary force on a subject during the execution of a warrant and later gave false statements during an internal investigation...although he later recanted his story and admitted to striking a suspect in handcuffs and later releasing him". Higgins resigned before disciplinary action could be imposed.
In September 2016, during his congressional campaign, Higgins claimed to have resigned from the police force for other reasons, calling Gallow "a peacock, a colorful, flightless bird". Gallow, by then retired as police chief, publicly disputed Higgins's version of events.
Higgins worked for the Port Barre police department through 2010. In 2011, he joined the St. Landry Parish sheriff's office. After the office's public information officer was reassigned in October 2014, Higgins was appointed to the position and promoted to captain. As public information officer, Higgins made videos for the parish Crime Stoppers program. He first used standard scripts, but began to improvise in his own style, appealing to suspects to surrender and sometimes threatening them by name. His videos went viral, and in 2015 he was described by national media as the "Cajun John Wayne" for his intimidating persona. Sheriff Bobby Guidroz urged restraint, advising Higgins to refrain from personal comments about suspects and to keep a professional tone in his videos.
Higgins also made a video for the state police, with a script that prompted protests from suspects' families and the ACLU. He resigned from the St. Landry Parish sheriff's office in February 2016. Guidroz had warned him against using disrespectful and demeaning language about suspects, ordering him to "Tone down his unprofessional comments on our weekly Crime Stoppers messages". He issued a statement saying that Higgins's comments underlined "a growing undertone of insubordination and lack of discipline on Higgins' part". Guidroz said that Higgins had gone against department policy by misusing his badge and uniform for personal profit and gain, citing Higgins's wearing a uniform in an ad for a security firm. He also reprimanded Higgins for using his badge and uniform on his personal website to support sales of T-shirts and shot glasses for his limited liability corporation (LLC). Higgins had also used the department's physical address in registering his corporation with the state. Both actions were against department policy.
Salon reported that during this period, Higgins "negotiated paid speaking appearances with other police departments. In one email, Higgins discussed his request for a speaker's fee that included shopping money for his wife and part of the fuel for a friend's private plane." He asked for cash payments. Higgins also conducted his private business via email on "his government email-account during work hours without the permission or knowledge of his supervisors. Higgins also appears to have attempted to conceal his earnings from the IRS in order to avoid wage garnishment for unpaid taxes. Whether those actions constitute tax fraud is unclear."
Shortly after resigning from St. Landry Parish, in March 2016, Higgins was accepted and sworn in as a reserve deputy marshal in the city of Lafayette, Louisiana. Reserve forces in city and Parish sheriff's offices in Louisiana receive regular training and are commissioned as law enforcement officers. They are part-time and made up of persons from many walks of life.
In 2019, Higgins retired his commission as a reserve deputy marshal. He maintains an active law enforcement commission as a reserve officer with the Louisiana attorney general's office.


=== Honors ===
Higgins was awarded the title of Kentucky colonel in March 2016 by Kentucky governor Matt Bevin.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==

=== Elections ===


==== 2016 ====
After Higgins's resignation from the St. Landry sheriff's office, Chris Comeaux, a Republican campaign staffer, recruited him to run for office. In May 2016, Higgins declared his candidacy in the 2016 election in the 3rd district. He crossed district lines to run for this seat, as his home in Port Barre is in the neighboring 5th district. Members of the House are only constitutionally required to live in the state they represent. A Super PAC headed by U.S. senator David Vitter's former chief of staff supported Higgins's candidacy.
Higgins finished second in the nonpartisan blanket primary held on November 8, behind Republican Scott Angelle, in which nearly 68% of the parish voted. He faced Angelle in a runoff election on December 10 and won with 56.1% of the vote; turnout had declined to about 28% of voters.


==== 2018 ====
Higgins was challenged by Democrats Rob Anderson, Mildred "Mimi" Methvin, Larry Rader, and Verone Thomas, Libertarian Aaron Andrus, and Republican Josh Guillory. Donald Trump endorsed Higgins. He defeated all six challengers in the jungle primary, winning reelection without a runoff.
In response to protests in response to the police shooting death of Trayford Pellerin, Higgins made a post on Facebook stating he would "drop 10 of you where you stand."


==== 2020 ====
Higgins was reelected with 67.76% of the vote to Democrat Braylon Harris's 17.89%, Democrat Rob Anderson's 11.59%, and Libertarian Brandon Leleux's 2.75%.


==== 2022 ====
Higgins was reelected with 64.3% of the vote to Republican Holden Hoggatt's 10.9%, Democrat Lessie Olivia Leblanc's 10.5%, Democrat Tia LeBrun's 9.4%, Republican Thomas "Lane" Payne, Jr.'s 1.8%, Independent Gloria R. Wiggins's 1.4%, Republican Jacob "Jake" Shaheen's 0.9%, and Libertarian Guy McLendon's 0.7%.


==== 2024 ====
Higgins was reelected with 70.6% of the vote. Democratic challengers Priscilla Gonzalez and Sadi Summerlin won 18.7% and 6.6% of the vote respectively, while Republican challenger Xan John won 4.1%.


=== Tenure ===

Higgins was sworn into the House of Representatives on January 3, 2017.
He has claimed to sleep on an air mattress on the floor of his Capitol Hill office. He works out and showers in the House gymnasium in the early morning.
Higgins voted with other Republicans in favor of the American Health Care Act of 2017, which would have repealed and replaced major portions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
In December 2017, Higgins voted with other Republicans in favor of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
On May 17, 2023, Higgins was recorded shoving, grabbing and moving a protester during an event in Washington DC.
During a House Homeland Security Committee hearing on November 15, 2023, Higgins floated an unfounded conspiracy theory that violence at the January 6 protests were caused by FBI agents infiltrating the protests through "ghost buses" and posing as Trump supporters.
On July 29, 2024, Higgins was announced as one of seven Republican members of a bipartisan task force investigating the attempted assassination of Donald Trump.


=== Committee assignments ===
For the 118th Congress:

Committee on Homeland Security
Subcommittee on Border Security and Enforcement (Chair)
Subcommittee on Emergency Management and Technology
Committee on Oversight and Accountability
Subcommittee on National Security, the Border, and Foreign Affairs
Subcommittee on Government Operations and the Federal Workforce


=== Caucus memberships ===
Republican Study Committee
Freedom Caucus


== Political positions ==


=== Abortion ===
Higgins is anti-abortion and has compared abortion to the Holocaust.


=== Guns ===
Higgins supports gun rights and opposes the regulation of firearms. In 2017, he said, "The modern hysteria over guns is another example of our weakened society. Guns weren't really regulated at all prior to the '60s in America. Throughout our history, prior to just 50 years ago, a child could purchase a gun from any seller, if Daddy sent him with the money."
Higgins has endorsed the use of firearms for political confrontation. He has appeared at rallies hosted by the Oath Keepers and publicly praised the Three Percenters, militia groups that advocate violent action against the United States government. In 2020, he posted on Facebook that he would "drop 10 of you where you stand", suggesting that he would use a gun to "end" the lives of protesters from a left-wing group who were also armed.


=== Immigration ===
In July 2018, House Democrats called for a floor vote on abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). House Republicans refused and called for the House to vote on a resolution by Higgins and Kevin McCarthy to support ICE.


=== LGBTQ rights ===
Higgins opposes same-sex marriage. He says he believes that states should have the right to ban same-sex marriage, contrary to the Supreme Court's ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges.


=== National security ===
Higgins supported Trump's 2017 executive order to temporarily curtail travel from certain countries, saying, "The president's executive order for a short-term restriction on visa entries from seven countries that are known to foster terrorists, combined with a systematic review of our immigration and vetting procedure, is reasonable."
Higgins has promoted himself and spoken at rallies by anti-government militia groups. When informed that a Black militia group protesting police brutality might show up at a protest, however, he suggested on Facebook in September 2020 that he would shoot them ("drop any 10 of you where you stand"). He included a picture of Black militia members at a protest. Facebook removed the post per its policy to remove content that "incites or facilitates serious violence".
On February 28, 2022, in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Higgins tweeted, "You millennial leftists who never lived one day under nuclear threat can now reflect upon your woke sky. You made quite a non-binary fuss to save the world from intercontinental ballistic tweets", the meaning of which became a subject of minor debate.


=== Texas v. Pennsylvania ===
In December 2020, Higgins was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated incumbent Donald Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.


=== COVID-19 ===
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Higgins was an outspoken skeptic, and asserted that the Chinese Communist Party had created the disease as biological warfare.
In May 2020 CNN interview, Higgins described face masks as a "bacteria trap" and said they did not help to slow the spread of COVID-19, noting that he did not believe they were effective as smells are able to pass through them.
In May 2021, Higgins wrote on Facebook, "I do not support mandatory vaccines, mask mandates or any form of required vaccine passport." In July 2021, he introduced a bill that would make it illegal for employers to mandate vaccination for their employees.
In the same month, Higgins confirmed that he and his wife had both contracted COVID-19 in January 2020, and that they had since contracted it a second time, along with their son. He has not publicly revealed his vaccination status.


=== Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 ===
Higgins was among the 71 Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 in the House.


=== Russia ===
On March 19, 2024, Higgins voted NAY to House Resolution 149 Condemning the illegal abduction and forcible transfer of children from Ukraine to the Russian Federation. He was one of nine Republicans to do so.


=== Veterans ===
The PACT ACT which expanded VA benefits to veterans exposed to toxic chemicals during their military service, received a "nay" from Higgins. Regarding cannabis, despite lobbying from VSOs such as the DAV Higgins also voted against 2022 MORE Act.


== Personal life ==
Higgins has been married four times. Higgins married Eloisa Rovati. They had a daughter together, who died a few months after she was born. Higgins and Rovati divorced. Rovati alleged that Higgins held a gun to her head and threatened to shoot her during an argument, a claim Higgins has repeatedly denied. Rovati later died in an automobile crash. Higgins then married Rosemary "Stormy" Rothkamm-Hambrice. He adopted her child from a previous marriage, and they had two more children together. They divorced in 1999. Higgins's third wife was Kara Seymour. They also divorced, and Higgins lives in Port Barre, Louisiana, with his fourth wife, Becca.
Rothkamm-Hambrice, then living in Mississippi, filed suit against him the day after the 2016 election for unpaid child support of more than $140,000, including interest on overdue payments. Higgins said that he sought reduced payments in 2005 after changing careers to law enforcement, but the issue was never settled. The Daily Advertiser reported: "Calls about the case made by this newspaper in September, first to the Texas Attorney General's Office, then to Louisiana courts, brought similar responses from both places: Clay Higgins was not in trouble with the courts in either state over the child support payments."
In August 2021, Higgins challenged a critic from Alaska who had called him a "traitor" for voting against certifying the 2020 election results to a physical fight in a ring, saying that he would be in Alaska in 2022; the challenge was accepted but no fight took place.
Higgins is Protestant.


=== Social media use ===
In early July 2017, Higgins posted a five-minute video on YouTube from Auschwitz concentration camp, including a section from within one of the gas chambers. He said, "This is why homeland security must be squared away, why our military must be invincible". This video was widely condemned as inappropriate, including by the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum, whose spokesman wrote in a Twitter post that "the building should not be used as a stage". Higgins later removed the video and issued an apology.
Several of Higgins's Facebook posts have been removed for contravening the company's policy against inciting violence. On September 1, 2020, Higgins posted a photograph of protesters at a Black Lives Matter protest in Louisiana, suggesting that armed demonstrators should be met with force to "eliminate the threat". After Facebook deleted the post, Higgins wrote: "We don’t care what color you are. We don’t care if you’re left or right. America is being manipulated into a new era of government control. Your liberty is threatened from within. [...] Welcome to the front lines, Ladies and Gentlemen. I suggest you get your mind right. I'll advise when it's time gear up, mount up, and roll out." This post was deleted for contravening the same policy.
In 2023, following the federal indictment of former President Donald Trump and Walt Nauta, Higgins Tweeted "President Trump said he has been summoned to appear at the Federal Courthouse in Miami on Tuesday, at 3 PM. This is a perimeter probe from the oppressors. Hold. rPOTUS has this. Buckle up. 1/50K know your bridges. Rock steady calm. That is all." Higgins later walked the call back with another Tweet saying "Let Trump handle Trump, he's got this". Higgins’ office issued a statement claiming that the real target of the indictment was not Trump but his supporters, and that the Department of Justice was attempting to provoke January 6-style events in order to provide a pretext to arrest conservatives.
On September 25, 2024, Higgins made a post on X disparaging Haitians, tweeting "Lol. These Haitians are wild. Eating pets, vudu [sic], nastiest country in the western hemisphere, cults, slapstick gangsters... but damned if they don't feel all sophisticated now, filing charges against our President and VP. All these thugs better get their mind right and their ass out of our country before January 20th." The tweet was deleted by Higgins hours later following backlash by both Democrats and Republicans. The Congressional Black Caucus introduced a resolution to censure Higgins for his post, characterizing it as "bigotry and racism".

James Michael Johnson (born January 30, 1972) is an American lawyer and politician serving as the 56th speaker of the United States House of Representatives since 2023. A member of the Republican Party, he is in his fifth House term, having represented Louisiana's 4th congressional district since 2017.
Johnson is a graduate of the Paul M. Hebert Law Center at Louisiana State University. Before entering politics, he worked as an attorney in private practice and for the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), a conservative Christian legal advocacy group. Johnson sat on the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention between 2004 and 2012.
Johnson's political career began when he was elected to the Louisiana House of Representatives in 2015; he served in that body until 2017. He was first elected to represent Louisiana's 4th congressional district in 2016. During his time in Congress, he contested the results of the 2020 presidential election on the House floor and in court. A social conservative, Johnson supported bills to ban abortion nationwide before saying that in the wake of the Dobbs decision, abortion policy was the purview of the states. Johnson chaired the Republican Study Committee, the largest caucus of conservatives in Congress, from 2019 to 2021. He was vice chair of the House Republican Conference from 2021 to 2023.
On October 25, 2023, after Speaker Kevin McCarthy was ousted from the position, Johnson was elected to replace him. As speaker, Johnson helped pass a bill meant to provide Ukraine with $60 billion of U.S. military aid. He was reelected to a full term as speaker in 2025.


== Early life and education ==
Johnson was born in Shreveport, Louisiana, the oldest of four children to Jeanne Johnson and James Patrick "Pat" Johnson (who died in 2016). He has said that he is the product of an unplanned pregnancy and that his parents were teenagers when he was born. They divorced after 23 years of marriage.
In 1984, while serving with the Shreveport Fire Department, Pat Johnson was severely injured and disabled in a fire at a cold storage facility. A fellow firefighter, Captain Percy R. Johnson, was killed in that fire. Pat Johnson never returned to work as a firefighter, choosing instead to become a HazMat consultant. He also co-founded the Percy R. Johnson Burn Foundation, which aided burn victims and their families.
The younger Johnson wanted to follow in his father's footsteps, but his parents encouraged him to take another course.
Johnson is a graduate of Captain Shreve High School in Shreveport. In 1995, he earned a Bachelor of Science in business administration from Louisiana State University, becoming a first-generation college graduate. In 1998, Johnson graduated from Louisiana State's Paul M. Hebert Law Center with a Juris Doctor degree.


== Legal career ==
Johnson was a constitutional lawyer before entering politics. He was senior legal counsel for the Alliance Defense Fund, now known as the Alliance Defending Freedom, a socially conservative legal advocacy group that subscribes to the legal theory of constitutionalism. In 2004, he defended Louisiana Amendment 1, which defined marriage as between one man and one woman within the Louisiana Constitution, against legal challenges.
In August 2010, Johnson was named the "founding dean" of the newly established Pressler School of Law at Louisiana College. The law school never opened, and Johnson resigned in August 2012. Joe Aguillard, accused by a university vice president of misappropriating money and lying to the board, blamed Johnson's resignation for the law school's failure. The college soon terminated Aguillard, as it was determined he "engaged in numerous improprieties and falsities in his representations not only to school donors, but to the Board of Trustees". The parent college has since been embroiled in administrative and legal problems.
Johnson served from 2004 to 2012 on the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention.
In 2015, Johnson founded Freedom Guard, a nonprofit law firm that engaged in religious liberty litigation. He was its chief counsel. During his time at Freedom Guard, he "defended the sports chaplaincy program at Louisiana State University from attacks that it was unconstitutional". Also, when Kentucky officials withdrew millions of dollars of tax breaks from the Ark Encounter theme park in Williamstown, Kentucky, Johnson represented Ark Encounter and its owner, Answers in Genesis, in a 2015 federal lawsuit. The court ruled in favor of Answers in Genesis, saying the state's exclusion of the ark from the tourism tax incentive based on its "religious purpose and message" violated the First Amendment. After the ruling, Johnson said: "The court has affirmed a longstanding principle that the Constitution does not permit a state to show hostility towards religion. The First Amendment does not allow Christian organizations to be treated like second-class citizens merely because of what they believe."
In September 2016, Johnson summarized his legal career as "defending religious freedom, the sanctity of human life, and biblical values, including the defense of traditional marriage, and other ideals like these when they've been under assault".
Johnson is a professor at Liberty University and teaches classes at its Helms School of Government. From roughly 2015 to 2022, he was an occasional guest host of Tony Perkins's radio talk show Washington Watch.


== Louisiana House of Representatives ==
The 8th District seat of the Louisiana House of Representatives was vacated in 2015 when Jeff R. Thompson was elected to a state district judgeship. Johnson ran to succeed him and was unopposed.
In April 2015, Johnson proposed the Marriage and Conscience Act. It would have prevented the state from engaging in adverse treatment of any person or entity based upon their beliefs about marriage. Critics denounced the bill as an attempt to protect people who discriminate against same-sex married couples. Governor Bobby Jindal pledged to sign Johnson's bill into law if it passed the legislature, commenting in a New York Times editorial that "musicians, caterers, photographers and others should be immune from government coercion on deeply held religious convictions". IBM and other employers in the region expressed opposition to the bill, including concerns about hiring difficulties it would likely produce. Other politicians also objected, including Republican Baton Rouge Metro Councilman John Delgado, who called Johnson a "despicable bigot of the highest order" for proposing the bill. Johnson replied that he "wished Delgado had taken the time to review his record and career before making 'such hateful, wildly inaccurate statements'".
On May 19, 2015, the House Civil Law and Procedure Committee voted 10–2 to table the bill, effectively ending its chances to become law. Both Republicans and Democrats voted against the bill; other than Johnson, only Republican Ray Garofalo voted for it. In response, Jindal issued an executive order to enforce its intent.
In 2016, Johnson was a strong proponent of a movement, outlined in Article V of the Constitution, to amend the United States Constitution at a national convention called for that purpose. He helped lead the Louisiana House in formally petitioning Congress to call a "Convention of States" to overhaul the Constitution. He later held hearings on this proposal in Congress.

=== Elections ===
On February 10, 2016, Johnson announced his candidacy for the 4th congressional district seat, which had been held for eight years by John Fleming. Fleming was running for the United States Senate seat vacated by David Vitter. Johnson won the election.
In 2018, Johnson won a second House term, defeating Democratic nominee Ryan Trundle, 139,307 votes (64%) to 72,923 votes (34%).
In 2020, Johnson won a third House term with 185,265 votes (60%) to Democratic nominee Kenny Houston's 78,157 votes (25%).
In 2022, Johnson won reelection unopposed.
In 2024, Johnson won reelection with 262,821 votes (86%) to fellow Republican Joshua Morott's 43,427 (14%) votes.


=== Early tenure ===

Johnson was sworn into office as a member of Congress on January 3, 2017. He has served as a deputy whip for House Republicans, as a member of the Judiciary Committee, and as a member of the Armed Services Committee. From 2019 to 2021, Johnson chaired the Republican Study Committee. Johnson served as vice chair of the House Republican Conference from 2021 to 2023. He was supported by the House Freedom Caucus PAC and frequently attended House Freedom Caucus meetings without formally joining the Caucus.
Johnson was among 147 Republicans who voted to overturn the 2020 presidential election results.
Johnson has worked closely with the Christian groups Answers in Genesis, Louisiana Family Forum, Alliance Defending Freedom, and Focus on the Family.
After the 2022 midterm elections, Representative Andy Biggs proposed Johnson as a possible compromise candidate for Speaker of the House instead of Republican Conference leader Kevin McCarthy, after members of the House Freedom Caucus opposed McCarthy's bid for the speakership.
In 2023, Johnson became chair of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution and Limited Government.

== Speaker of the House ==


=== Nomination ===

After Kevin McCarthy was removed from the position of speaker of the House on October 3, 2023, Representative Matt Gaetz floated Johnson's name as a potential replacement. On October 13, Johnson said that he would not run in the upcoming speaker election to succeed McCarthy and endorsed colleague Jim Jordan; on the same day, NBC News reported that Johnson was considering running if Jordan dropped out.
On October 21, after Steve Scalise and Jordan had made unsuccessful bids for speaker, Johnson declared his candidacy to become the new Republican nominee for speaker but was beaten by Representative Tom Emmer on October 24. Emmer defeated Johnson, 117 votes to 97, on the fifth ballot. Shortly thereafter, Emmer withdrew his candidacy for the speakership. Later on the same day, House Republicans voted to make Johnson their fourth nominee for speaker; he beat write-in candidate Kevin McCarthy and Representative Byron Donalds, 128 votes to 43 and 29, on the third ballot. Johnson's bid was endorsed by former U.S. president Donald Trump.
On October 25, the full House voted, 220–209, to elect Johnson as the 56th Speaker of the United States House of Representatives with every Republican member in attendance voting for him. Johnson was also sworn in as speaker on the same day. He is the first speaker in U.S. history from Louisiana. Johnson had served the shortest tenure of any House member elected speaker, at six years and ten months, since John G. Carlisle in 1883. Delivering his first remarks as speaker, he said, "I believe that Scripture, the Bible, is very clear: that God is the one who raises up those in authority. He raised up each of you. All of us."


=== 118th Congress ===

In the first half of the 118th Congress, when McCarthy was speaker, the House of Representatives had passed into law the lowest number of bills of any previous Congress, partially due to the unrest among members of the Freedom Caucus and McCarthy. McCarthy's removal had not put an end to the divided House, and Johnson sparked some anger over his handling of spending negotiations. An effort to oust him from the speakership in May 2024 failed with two-thirds of the House voting to keep him in office.
On October 26, 2023, Johnson met with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia during the latter's state visit to the United States. Later that day, he also met with President Joe Biden for the first time as speaker before attending a bipartisan briefing held at the White House on the administration's proposed funding requests for aid to Ukraine and Israel. On October 30, Johnson suggested rescinding IRS funding from the Inflation Reduction Act to provide Israel $14.3 billion in aid.
In November, Johnson proposed a two-tiered stopgap bill that continued spending at around current levels. The bill was opposed by House conservatives and the Freedom Caucus, but passed the House on November 14 with the support of 209 Democrats and 127 Republicans. It passed the Senate on the next day and was signed by Biden.
On November 17, Johnson announced that 44,000 hours of security footage from the January 6 United States Capitol attack, all of which had previously only been available upon request from criminal defendants and the media, would be released to the general public. The announcement came after a pledge Johnson made to conservative hardliners during his run for speaker and was welcomed by Donald Trump. According to CBS News, there was no deadline to post the videos, and one person would need "five years of 24-hour-per-day viewing" to watch them all. At least some of the videos are available on a government website.
On December 1, the House expelled Republican congressman George Santos by a 311–114 vote; Johnson voted against the expulsion, and called it "a regrettable day".
On February 13, 2024, the House impeached Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas by a 214–213 vote. The impeachment resolution, championed by Johnson, had been already put up to a vote on February 6, but had failed due to a small Republican rebellion.
During the more than three weeks it took for House Republicans to elect a speaker, they were unable to pass any appropriations legislation. Johnson announced he would support another continuing resolution to extend funding for some departments until January 19 and others until February 2. Conservatives opposed the measures, but were not ready to offer a motion to vacate.
On January 7, 2024, congressional appropriators reached an agreement on the topline spending levels for 2024 that was not substantially different from the deal McCarthy negotiated. Hardliners attempted to push Johnson to abandon the deal, initially claiming that he had done so before Johnson clarified that he hadn't. As negotiations continued over the full-year funding bills, conservatives pushed Johnson to instead endorse a full-year continuing resolution, which under McCarthy's deal would result in automatic spending cuts.

On March 6, 2024, the House passed a $459 billion "minibus" spending package containing six of the twelve appropriations bills. The bill funded the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Justice, Energy, Interior, Veterans Affairs, Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development. It also provided appropriations for the EPA, the Army Corps of Engineers, and other military construction. The rightmost faction of the Republican conference harshly opposed the deal, arguing it contained no substantial conservative policy wins.
On March 22, the House passed a second $741 billion minibus to fund the remaining departments; a majority of Republicans voted against the bill, but it passed thanks to Democratic support. The bill's passage, and the decision to rely on Democratic votes to get it through, led representative Marjorie Taylor Greene to file a motion to vacate Johnson's speakership. Greene could have forced a vote on the motion immediately, but initially chose not to, saying that she merely intended to send Johnson "a warning".
In April 2024, more than two months after the Senate had passed a funding bill for Israel, Taiwan, and Ukraine, Johnson put forward a legislative package providing aid to the three countries in separate bills, each of which passed Congress with bipartisan support and large majorities and was signed into law by President Biden. The legislative package also included a House-passed bill to force the app TikTok to divest from its Chinese Communist Party-controlled parent company, ByteDance, as well as the REPO for Ukrainians Act, a measure that allows the U.S. government to fund the Ukrainian war effort with assets seized from Russian oligarchs.
On May 8, 2024, Greene (who had strongly opposed Johnson's resolve to provide Ukraine with further aid) introduced the motion to vacate Johnson's speakership on the floor, forcing a vote on it within two legislative days. The House voted to table (kill) the motion by a vote of 359 to 43, allowing Johnson to remain speaker. 196 Republicans and 163 Democrats voted to kill the resolution; 11 Republicans and 32 Democrats voted against killing the resolution. The Democrats who supported Johnson claimed they did so because of the vital role he had played in providing funding for the federal government and for Ukraine. 

In October 2024, after Hurricane Helene impacted several American states, Johnson called the federal government's response a "massive failure". Johnson did not call Congress for a special session to address hurricane relief, saying it would be "premature" to return to Washington before assessing how much disaster relief is needed. He said, "We'll be back in session immediately after the election" and that Congress would address "specific needs and requests based upon the actual damages" of the hurricane, which "takes a while to calculate".
The 118th Congress (in which Johnson and McCarthy each served as speaker) saw 209 bills enacted into law, among the lowest number of bills passed by any Congress in decades. Since 2000, the average number of bills passed per congress had been 372. Since 1989, the average number had been 380. No congress had enacted fewer laws since the first half of the 20th century.


=== 119th Congress ===
In the 2024 elections, Republicans maintained control of the House, flipped control of the U.S. Senate, and won the presidency, yielding an undivided Republican government. On January 3, 2025, the opening day of the 119th Congress, Johnson was reelected speaker on the first ballot, with every Republican vote except Thomas Massie, who voted for Tom Emmer, and every Democrat voting for House minority leader and Leader of the House Democratic Caucus Hakeem Jeffries.
In early January, as Trump was transitioning to the presidency, Johnson and House Republicans reached an agreement to raise the debt ceiling by $1.5 trillion to fulfill Trump's legislative prospects. This came after Trump called for Congress to craft "one powerful bill"—a request he later retracted—to deal with energy, the southern border, and taxes. When asked whether cuts to Social Security and Medicare would be part of Trump's agenda, Johnson said they would not.


=== Assessments of speakership ===
When Johnson became House speaker, he was the least experienced representative to fill the office in 140 years. Axios wrote that Johnson's "status as a relatively unknown figure outside Capitol Hill meant he had few enemies to derail his campaign." Representative Ken Buck, a Republican from Colorado, echoed this sentiment, saying Johnson had won the speakership "because he has the fewest enemies of anybody in the Republican Party".
In May 2024, Politico wrote that Johnson had aligned himself with former President Trump "while not being treated like a golden retriever" and that he had "fortified his reputation in consequential ways. Substantively, Johnson is an authentic movement conservative" who has been "successful in isolating his critics". According to Politico, he has "proved deft in recent months at handling his members." House Republicans have praised him for keeping his word and avoiding "making promises he can't keep", while he has operated in good faith with Democrats and "stayed respectful of the opposition".
In May 2024, conservative columnist Marc Thiessen wrote in The Washington Post that "Johnson has gone from accidental House speaker to one of the most consequential House speakers in a generation" and that despite presiding over the smallest House majority in U.S. history, Johnson had become "one of the most effective speakers ever".
In a Washington Times editorial, former Republican speaker Newt Gingrich wrote that he was "deeply impressed" with Johnson, who he believes is "doing an excellent job" despite having "the most challenging speakership since the Civil War".
Former Democratic speaker Nancy Pelosi said she respected Johnson and that "we have not that much in common, philosophically, but if you can trust somebody to be a person of his or her word you can find common ground."
In July 2024, the editorial board at The Wall Street Journal published an opinion piece titled "Mike Johnson, Leader of the Free World", in which it wrote that in a recent speech at the Hudson Institute, Johnson "laid down a marker for a GOP that rejects U.S. decline and retreat abroad... He didn't indulge a false choice between meeting problems at home and threats abroad. He is pushing his party in the direction of Ronald Reagan, which is correct for the world moment and politically popular."


== Political positions ==


=== 2020 presidential election ===

In early November 2020, after many pollsters and media outlets called the 2020 United States presidential election in favor of Joe Biden over Donald Trump, Johnson said that he spoke to Trump twice, recounting that he urged Trump to "exhaust every available legal remedy to restore Americans' trust in the fairness of our election system" and that he was heartened by Trump's intention to ensure "that all instances of fraud and illegality are investigated and prosecuted".
On November 17, 2020, Johnson said: "You know the allegations about these voting machines, some of them being rigged with this software by Dominion, there's a lot of merit to that. And when the president says the election was rigged, that's what he's talking about. The fix was in. [...] a software system that is used all around the country that is suspect because it came from Hugo Chávez's Venezuela". By October 2022, Johnson said that he had never supported claims that there was massive fraud in the 2020 election.
In December 2020, Johnson led an effort in which 126 Republican U.S. representatives signed an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.
During the January 2021 United States Electoral College vote count, Johnson was one of 120 U.S. representatives who objected to certifying the 2020 presidential election results from both Arizona and Pennsylvania, while another 19 U.S. representatives objected for one of these states. The New York Times called Johnson "the most important architect of the Electoral College objections" because he had argued to reject the results based on the argument of "constitutional infirmity" and persuaded "about three-quarters" of the objectors to use that rationale. Johnson's argument was that certain state officials had violated the Constitution by relaxing restrictions on mail-in voting or early voting due to the COVID-19 pandemic without consulting state legislatures.
On May 19, 2021, Johnson and all other seven Republican House leaders in the 117th Congress voted against establishing a national commission to investigate the January 6, 2021, storming of the United States Capitol. Thirty-five Republican House members and all 217 Democrats present voted to establish the commission.


=== Abortion ===

In 2015, Johnson blamed abortions and the "breakup [of] the nuclear family" for school shootings, saying, "when you tell a generation of people that life has no value, no meaning, that it's expendable, then you do wind up with school shooters." In 2015 and 2016, he led an anti-abortion "Life March" in Shreveport-Bossier City.
Johnson opposed Roe v. Wade. In Congress, he has supported bills outlawing abortion both at fertilization and at 15 weeks' gestation. In a 2017 House Judiciary Committee meeting, Johnson argued that Roe v. Wade made it necessary to cut social programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid because abortion reduced the labor force and thus damaged the economy.
Johnson has co-sponsored bills attempting to ban abortion nationwide, such as the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, the Protecting Pain-Capable Unborn Children From Late-Term Abortions Act, and the Heartbeat Protection Act of 2021. All three bills would impose criminal penalties, including potential prison terms of up to five years, upon doctors who perform abortions.
In January 2023, the House passed a resolution Johnson introduced that condemned "vandalism, violence, and destruction against pro-life facilities, groups, and churches", and added that the House "recognizes the sanctity of life and the important role pro-life facilities, groups, and churches play in supporting pregnant women, infants, and families".  At the same time the House passed several bills to assist pregnant women and students.
In the wake of the Dobbs decision, Johnson said that abortion policy was the purview of the states. In May 2024, he said he would not try to pass a nationwide abortion ban.


=== Climate change and the environment ===

During a town hall in 2017, Johnson said that he believed that Earth's climate was changing, but questioned the scientific consensus that climate change is caused by humans.
As of October 2023, Johnson had received $338,125 in donations from the oil and gas industry during his congressional career.


=== Covenant marriage ===
Johnson came to some prominence in the late 1990s when he and his wife appeared on television to promote new laws in Louisiana allowing covenant marriages, under which divorce is much more difficult to obtain than in no-fault divorce. In 2005, Johnson appeared on ABC's Good Morning America to promote covenant marriages, saying, "I'm a big proponent of marriage and fidelity and all the things that go with it".


=== Donald Trump ===

In 2015, Johnson wrote on Facebook that "Donald Trump ... lacks the character and the moral center we desperately need again in the White House", adding: "I am afraid he would break more things than he fixes. He is a hot head by nature, and that is a dangerous trait to have in a Commander in Chief. ... I just don't think he has the demeanor to be President."
In 2019, during Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, Johnson defended Trump, saying that Trump had "cooperated fully" with the investigation and "done nothing wrong".
In 2019, during the first impeachment of Donald Trump, Johnson defended Trump and told White House officials to ignore Congressional subpoenas as "legitimate executive privilege in legal immunity". He served as a member of Trump's legal defense team during both the 2019 and 2021 Senate impeachment trials, each of which resulted in acquittal.
Johnson endorsed Trump's 2024 campaign for president, and Trump has endorsed Johnson. Johnson and Trump are considered close allies, having worked closely together since 2017. Trump has called Johnson "a good man who is trying very hard" and "doing a very good job".
Trump endorsed Johnson in his 2025 speaker bid, and Johnson secured the speakership only after Trump directly spoke with holdout votes. Johnson attended Trump's second inauguration.


=== Economic policy ===
In December 2017, Johnson voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. After voting for the Act, he called the economy "stunted" and a "burden" on Americans, adding, "The importance of this moment cannot be overstated. With the first comprehensive tax reform in 31 years, we will dramatically strengthen the U.S. economy and restore economic mobility and opportunity for hardworking individuals and families all across this country."
In 2018, Johnson said that entitlement reform is his "number one priority", adding that reforms to entitlement programs have to "happen yesterday" to maintain their long-term solvency.
In 2019, Johnson opposed the Raise the Wage Act, which would raise the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour, calling it "job-crushing legislation". In 2021, Johnson again opposed the bill.


=== Evolution ===
Johnson rejects the scientific consensus on evolution. He helped the Creation Museum secure millions of dollars in tax subsidies to build a life-sized Ark Encounter, which teaches the discredited claim that dinosaurs accompanied Noah on his Ark and that the earth is 6,000 years old. In 2016, Johnson delivered a sermon that called the teaching of evolution one of the causes of mass shootings: "People say, 'How can a young person go into their schoolhouse and open fire on their classmates?' Because we've taught a whole generation—a couple generations now—of Americans: that there's no right or wrong, that it's about survival of the fittest, and you evolve from the primordial slime. Why is that life of any sacred value? Because there's nobody sacred to whom it's owed."


=== Foreign policy ===


==== China and Taiwan ====
In 2020, Johnson co-wrote a national security report with a section on China trade issues as the leader of the Republican Study Committee. The report called for tougher sanctions on companies and individuals affiliated with the People's Liberation Army as well as the expansion of trade with countries such as Taiwan, Indonesia and Mongolia to counter China. Before 2023, he introduced two bills about China; one that would ban former members of the United States Congress from lobbying for communist entities and another to forbid foreign governments from funding litigation in U.S. courts.
In July 2024, he promised to pass several bills that propose tough policies on China, saying during a speech to Hudson Institute that "China poses the greatest threat to global peace. Congress must keep our focus on countering China with every tool at our disposal". In December 2024, Johnson spoke with Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te during a stopover in Hawaii.


==== Foreign Intelligence Surveillance ====
In 2024, Johnson opposed a new warrant requirement for the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). He had previously been a critic of the program, but said that learning more about it and attending classified briefings had convinced him that FISA reauthorization was vital to national security.


==== Russian invasion of Ukraine ====

In February 2022, Johnson condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine and called for "sanctions on Russia’s economic interests" and Russia's exclusion from "global commerce and international institutions". In April 2022, he voted for the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2022. Before becoming speaker of the House, Johnson twice voted against assisting Ukraine in its war against Russia by sending military and financial aid. In February 2023, he said: "American taxpayers have sent over $100 billion in aid to Ukraine in the last year. They deserve to know if the Ukrainian government is being entirely forthcoming and transparent about the use of this massive sum of taxpayer resources." After he became speaker, Johnson said he was "open to talks" about Biden's request for additional funds to help the Ukrainian "counter-offensive against Russia". In December 2023, he said that aid for Ukraine would be predicated on new border-security measures. In January 2024, he opposed a bipartisan, Senate Republican-sponsored border security package that included aid for Ukraine and other U.S. allies. The bill failed to pass the Senate.
In April 2024, Johnson put forward a $61 billion aid package for Ukraine that contained no border-related provision, which passed in Congress with bipartisan support and was signed into law by President Biden. Some media and politicians called this a "Churchill or Chamberlain" moment, referring to British prime ministers at the beginning of World War II. Johnson said the classified briefings he had received about events unfolding in Ukraine played a significant role in his decision.


==== Israel–Palestine relations ====

Johnson visited Israel in February 2020 with 12Tribe Films Foundation.
The first measure the House considered after Johnson became speaker was a resolution expressing support for Israel after the October 7 attacks led by Hamas. Johnson voted for the resolution. On November 2, 2023, the House passed a Johnson-supported bill to give Israel $14.3 billion in aid. On November 14, 2023, Johnson said calls for a ceasefire in the Israel–Hamas war in the Gaza Strip were "outrageous", adding, "Israel will cease their counter-offensive when Hamas ceases to be a threat to the Jewish state."
AIPAC, a large pro-Israel lobbyist organization, was Johnson's largest financial donor in 2023.

In April 2024, Johnson criticized pro-Palestinian protests on U.S. university campuses, saying he was determined "that Congress will not be silent as Jewish students are expected to run for their lives and stay home from their classes hiding in fear."


=== Health care ===
Johnson voted for the American Health Care Act of 2017, which would have repealed the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
In 2019, in his capacity as chair of the Republican Study Committee, Johnson spearheaded an effort to replace the ACA. The committee's plan would have rescinded the ACA's Medicaid expansion.


=== Immigration ===
Johnson supported Trump's 2017 executive order to prohibit immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries, saying: "This is not an effort to ban any religion, but rather an effort to adequately protect our homeland. We live in a dangerous world, and this important measure will help us balance freedom and security."
As of 2023, Johnson had "introduced legislation three times aimed at tightening the asylum system, including by raising the bar on undocumented immigrants to establish their claim of fear of persecution".
In January 2024, Johnson opposed a bipartisan, Senate Republican-backed border security and immigration bill that would also provide funding for Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan. That bill failed to pass the Senate. During border negotiations, Johnson said that he discussed immigration policy frequently with Trump.


=== In-vitro fertilization and embryonic stem-cell research ===
In 2023, Johnson co-sponsored legislation declaring that human life and personhood begin at conception with no exception for in-vitro fertilization treatments involving embryos or embryonic stem-cell research. In 2024, after public backlash to an Alabama Supreme Court decision ruling that embryos are children under Alabama state law, meaning fertility clinics were liable for the loss of embryos as if they were children, Johnson announced that he supports access to in-vitro fertilization. But on March 7, 2024, he clarified that he does not support federal legislation to protect legal access to IVF, saying he believes it is a state issue. Johnson has said IVF "is a remarkable thing and something we ought to preserve and protect".


=== LGBTQ rights ===
In 2023, Andrew Kaczynski of CNN wrote that Johnson "has a history of harsh anti-gay language from his time as an attorney for a socially conservative legal group in the mid-2000s". Kaczynski pointed to editorials Johnson wrote in the early 2000s in his local paper, The Shreveport Times, calling homosexuality "inherently unnatural" and a "dangerous lifestyle". When asked about the editorials, Johnson said, "I don't even remember some of them...I was a litigator that was called upon to defend the state marriage amendments." Johnson said he is a Bible-believing Christian who genuinely loves all people and respects the rule of law.
In a 2003 article, Johnson wrote: "Homosexuals do not meet the criteria for a suspect class under the equal protection clause because they are neither disadvantaged nor identified on the basis of immutable characteristics, as all are capable of changing their abnormal lifestyles." He wrote that legalizing same-sex marriage could put the country's "entire democratic system in jeopardy". In another article, he wrote, "experts project that homosexual marriage is the dark harbinger of chaos and sexual anarchy that could doom even the strongest republic".
Johnson opposed the 2003 U.S. Supreme Court decision Lawrence v. Texas, which held that most criminal punishment of private sexual conduct between consenting adults is unconstitutional. Johnson's employer at the time, the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), submitted an amicus brief that supported maintaining criminalization. In a 2003 editorial, Johnson wrote, "States have many legitimate grounds to proscribe same-sex deviate sexual intercourse."
In 2005, Johnson campaigned against GLSEN's annual anti-bullying Day of Silence, telling NBC News: "that's cloaking their real message—that homosexuality is good for society".
Johnson opposed Obergefell v. Hodges, the Supreme Court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage nationally. In an interview shortly after he was elected speaker, Johnson said, "I am a rule-of-law guy. I made a career defending the rule of law. I respect the rule of law. When the Supreme Court issued the Obergefell opinion, that became the law of the land, OK."
In 2022, Johnson introduced the Stop the Sexualization of Children Act, which would prohibit federally funded institutions, including public schools and libraries, from mentioning sexual orientation or gender identity. The bill has been compared to the Florida Parental Rights in Education Act, commonly referred to as the "Don't Say Gay" law.

At a July 2023 hearing on transgender youth, Johnson spoke against allowing children to receive gender-affirming care, saying: "Our American legal system recognizes the important public interest in protecting children from abuse and physical harm". He has co-sponsored legislation that would make it a felony to provide opposite-sex hormones or gender-affirming surgeries to minors.
In November 2024, Johnson announced a new policy on bathrooms in the U.S. Capitol, saying: "All single-sex facilities in the Capitol and House Office Buildings—such as restrooms, changing rooms, and locker rooms—are reserved for individuals of that biological sex. It is important to note that each Member office has its own private restroom, and unisex restrooms are available throughout the Capitol." The new policy was enacted less than a month after the election of Sarah McBride, the first openly transgender person elected to Congress.


=== Marijuana ===

In 2016, Johnson opposed the expansion of medical marijuana in Louisiana. He argued that medical marijuana can actually worsen some conditions, specifically epilepsy, quoting the American Epilepsy Society's studies that it can cause "severe dystonic reactions and other movement disorders, developmental regression, intractable vomiting, and worsening seizures" in children with epilepsy.
As of 2023, Johnson had twice voted against the decriminalization of marijuana.


=== Religion ===

Johnson is a member of the Christian right faction of the Republican Party. His inaugural speech as speaker of the House emphasized his Southern Baptist beliefs as the basis for his politics.
Johnson has referred to the "so-called separation of church and state". He has asserted that "the founders wanted to protect the church from an encroaching state, not the other way around."
In April 2018, Johnson joined Republican state Attorney General Jeff Landry and Christian actor Kirk Cameron to argue under the First Amendment for student-led prayer and religious expression in public schools.
Johnson has cited David Barton, an evangelical author and political activist, as influential to him.


== Personal life ==

Johnson married Kelly Renee Lary on May 1, 1999. Their primary residence is in Benton, Louisiana. The Speaker's lodgings in Washington, D.C., are most likely in his Cannon Office Building office. 
The Johnsons have five children, including an adult son, Michael Tirrell James. Johnson and his wife met James, who is black, at an event for Young Life Ministries, took him in, and assumed legal guardianship when he was 14 years old. James, who maintains a private life with his family, has said "if the Johnsons hadn't taken me in as a teenager, my life would look very different today."
In a 2015 German television story about the purity movement, Johnson and his then 13-year-old daughter Hannah were featured attending a purity ball.
Johnson and his wife have co-hosted the podcast Truth Be Told since March 2022, discussing public affairs and other issues from a Christian perspective. On his podcast, Johnson said that "the Word of God is, of course, the ultimate source of all truth", and attributed the success of the United States to its foundation upon a "religious statement of faith".
Johnson describes himself as first and foremost a Christian. An evangelical and Southern Baptist, he has said, "My faith informs everything I do."

Andrew Peter Harris (born January 25, 1957) is an American politician and physician serving as the U.S. representative for Maryland's 1st congressional district. The district includes the entire Eastern Shore, as well as several eastern exurbs of Baltimore County. He is the only Republican member of Maryland's congressional delegation.
Prior to entering politics, Harris worked as an anesthesiologist at Johns Hopkins University and served as a commanding officer for the Johns Hopkins Naval Reserve Medical Unit from 1989 to 1992. He was elected to the Maryland Senate in 1998, after defeating incumbent F. Vernon Boozer in the Republican primary. He first represented the 9th district from 1993 to 2003, then the 7th district until 2011; both districts included parts of northeastern Baltimore County.
Harris was first elected to Congress in 2010, after defeating incumbent Frank Kratovil in the general election. He became the chair of the House Freedom Caucus in September 2024, after his predecessor, Bob Good, lost his Republican primary in June 2024.


== Early life, education, and career ==
Harris's father was Zoltán Harris, an anesthesiologist who was born in Miskolc, Hungary, in 1911 and emigrated to the U.S. in 1950; his mother, Irene (Koczerzuk), was born in Zarice, Poland. Harris was born in New York, grew up in Queens, and attended Regis High School in Manhattan.
Harris earned his BS in biology (1977) and his MD (1980) from Johns Hopkins University. The university's Bloomberg School of Hygiene and Public Health conferred his MHS in 1995 in health policy and management and health finance and management.
Harris served in the Navy Medical Corps and the U.S. Naval Reserve as a commander on active duty during Operation Desert Storm. He previously worked as an anesthesiologist, an associate professor of anesthesiology and critical care medicine, and as chief of obstetric anesthesiology at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. Harris also served as commanding officer for the Johns Hopkins Naval Reserve Medical Unit from 1989 to 1992.


== Maryland General Assembly ==
Harris was first elected to the Maryland Senate in 1998 for District 9, including part of Baltimore County. He defeated his predecessor, Minority Leader F. Vernon Boozer, in the 1998 primary election. A major factor in the race was Boozer's role in derailing an attempt to ban partial-birth abortion a year earlier; the bill's sponsor, fellow state senator Larry Haines, supported Harris's primary bid. In the general election he defeated Democratic nominee Anthony O. Blades.
Harris's district was later redrawn to be District 7, representing parts of Harford County, succeeding Norman Stone. He defeated Democratic nominee Diane DeCarlo in the general election in 2002, and from 2003 to 2006 served as the minority whip. He was reelected in 2006, defeating Patricia A. Foerster. He was succeeded by J. B. Jennings.
In August 2001, following speculation that U.S. representative Bob Ehrlich would run for governor of Maryland in 2002, Harris formed an exploratory committee to explore a potential run for Congress in Maryland's 2nd congressional district. He ultimately decided against running.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 2008 ====

Harris defeated incumbent Republican Wayne Gilchrest and state senator E. J. Pipkin in the Republican primary for Maryland's 1st congressional district. Harris ran well to the right of Gilchrest, a moderate Republican. He explained that he was upset with Gilchrest's decision to support a Democrat-sponsored bill setting a timetable for troop withdrawal from Iraq and suspected that many of his constituents also felt that way. He was endorsed by the Club for Growth, which raised nearly $250,000 for him, former governor Bob Ehrlich, seven of 10 state senators who represent parts of the district, and House minority leader Anthony O'Donnell. His general election opponent, Queen Anne's County state's attorney Frank Kratovil, criticized the Club for Growth's policies, and Harris for having its support. Gilchrest endorsed Kratovil.
On paper, Harris had a strong advantage in the general election due to its Republican lean. Although Democrats and Republicans are nearly tied in registration, the district has a strong tinge of social conservatism that favors Republicans. It had been in Republican hands for all but 14 years since 1947, although Kratovil received a significant boost when Gilchrest endorsed him.
On election night, Kratovil led Harris by 915 votes. After two rounds of counting absentee ballots, Kratovil's lead grew to 2,000 votes. Forecasting that there was little chance for Harris to close the gap, most media outlets declared Kratovil the winner on the night of November 7. Harris conceded on November 11.
Harris dominated his longtime base in Baltimore's heavily Republican eastern suburbs, which account for most of the district's share of Baltimore County, but failed to carry a single county on the Eastern Shore.


==== 2010 ====

Harris ran again in the 1st District in 2010. He defeated Rob Fisher, a conservative businessman, in the primary.
Harris's primary win set up a rematch against Kratovil. Libertarian Richard James Davis and Independent Jack Wilson also ran. In the November 2 general election, Harris defeated Kratovil by 14%.


==== 2012 ====

The National Journal's Cook Political Report named Harris one of the top 10 Republicans most vulnerable to redistricting in 2012, noting that Maryland Democrats could redraw Harris's home in Cockeysville out of the 1st. Instead, Roscoe Bartlett's 6th District was redrawn. Some of Bartlett's shares of Harford, Baltimore, and Carroll counties were drawn into the 1st, making this already strongly Republican district even more so.
Harris was reelected, defeating Democratic nominee Wendy Rosen with 67% of the vote. Rosen withdrew from the race after being confronted with evidence that she had voted in both Maryland and Florida in the 2006 and 2008 elections. Rosen had property in Florida, and Maryland law allowed property owners to vote in local elections even if they live elsewhere. But her Florida voting registration reportedly also gave her access to state and federal elections there, which was prohibited by Maryland law. At the time Rosen withdrew, ballots had already been printed. John LaFerla, who had narrowly lost to Rosen in the primary, was endorsed as Rosen's replacement, but could only be a write-in.


==== 2014 ====

Harris defeated Democratic nominee Bill Tilghman with over 70% of the vote.


==== 2016 ====

Harris won the Republican primary, defeating three challengers with 78.4% of the vote. Former Maryland state delegate Mike Smigiel came in second place with 10.8%. Smigiel ran because he opposed Harris's strident opposition to marijuana decriminalization in the District of Columbia.
In the general election, Harris won another term with 229,135 votes (67.8%), defeating Democratic nominee Joe Werner, a "little-known Harford County attorney and perennial candidate" who received 94,776 votes (28%). Libertarian candidate Matt Beers received 14,207 votes (4.2%). In February 2016, Harris was the first congressman to endorse Ben Carson for the Republican nomination for president. Carson dropped out two weeks later after a poor performance in the Super Tuesday March 1 primaries.


==== 2018 ====

While Harris was running for reelection, the Maryland Democratic Party accused him of ethics violations, alleging that he might have violated ethics rules requiring members to report the source of spousal income and assets. In response, the Harris campaign said the omission was a mistake, and Harris amended his filing once he became aware of the error.
In the general election, Harris defeated Democratic nominee Jesse Colvin with 60% of the vote.


==== 2020 ====

Harris defeated Democratic nominee Mia Mason with over 63% of the vote.


==== 2022 ====

Harris had initially promised to serve only six terms (12 years) in the House, but opted to run again in 2022. Maryland state legislators had passed a new congressional map that gave Democrats an advantage over Republicans in all eight of the state's congressional districts, but the map was ruled unconstitutional by Judge Lynne A. Battaglia in March 2022. Afterwards, legislators passed a new map that was signed into law by Governor Larry Hogan in April 2022, which returned the district to being solidly Republican. In the general election, Harris faced former state delegate Heather Mizeur, whom he sought to portray as a tax-approving liberal who would increase federal spending and support Nancy Pelosi as Speaker of the United States House of Representatives. Mizeur, in turn, characterized Harris as an ineffective legislator and criticized him for challenging the results of the 2020 presidential election and for supporting the Life at Conception Act. Harris defeated Mizeur with 54.4 percent of the vote, his closest race since his 2010 victory.


==== 2024 ====

Harris was re-elected to an eighth term in 2024, defeating Democratic challenger Blaine Miller III in the general election with 59.41% of the vote.


=== Committee assignments ===
For the 118th Congress:

Committee on Appropriations
Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies (Chair)
Subcommittee on Homeland Security
Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies


=== Caucus memberships ===
Freedom Caucus


== Political positions ==

During the 117th United States Congress, GovTrack rated Harris as the 60th most conservative member of the House of Representatives. The Washington Post described Harris as "an ardent supporter of President Donald Trump", whose right-wing populism he has called the "future of the Republican Party". He initially endorsed neurosurgeon Ben Carson for president during the 2016 Republican primaries, but later backed Trump after Carson suspended his campaign. A member of the House Freedom Caucus, Harris unsuccessfully ran for chairmanship of the Republican Study Committee in 2016, during which he campaigned on uniting the caucus and committee.


=== Domestic policy ===


==== Abortion ====
Harris identifies as "pro-life". He has consistently received 0 percent ratings from pro-choice groups, including NARAL Pro-Choice America, and 100 percent ratings from anti-abortion groups, such as the National Right to Life and the Susan B. Anthony List.
During the 2000 legislative session, Harris introduced a bill to ban abortions after fetal viability.
In 2004, Harris cosigned a letter opposing the Ronald Reagan and Christopher Reeve Stem Cell Research Act, which would require the state to provide $25 million toward stem cell research annually. He also introduced the Human Cloning Prohibition Act, a bill to ban stem cell research in Maryland. In 2006, Harris filibustered a bill to provide $25 million a year toward stem cell research.
In 2006, Harris opposed a bill to allow pharmacists to provide patients with emergency contraception without a prescription. In July 2014, he praised the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., which exempted privately held for-profit corporations from having to cover contraception under the Affordable Care Act. In 2023, Harris cosigned an amicus brief to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit supporting a lower court ruling in Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v. FDA, which temporarily repealed the Food and Drug Administration's approval of mifepristone.
In 2015, following the release of undercover videos by the Center for Medical Progress, an anti-abortion group, that purportedly showed Planned Parenthood selling tissues from aborted fetuses, Harris spoke in support of a bill to block Medicaid funds from health care providers that performed abortions. He was later appointed to the United States House Select Investigative Panel on Planned Parenthood.
During the 2019 State of the Union Address, Harris praised remarks made by President Donald Trump on efforts to restrict women's access to abortion.
In 2021, Harris cosponsored the Life at Conception Act, a bill to ban abortions without exceptions. In June 2022, Harris celebrated the Supreme Court's ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade. Following the ruling, Harris said he would support a federal six-week abortion ban. In July 2022, Harris voted against bills codifying Roe, to protect patients who travel across state lines to get an abortion, and to protect the right to contraception. During a debate in October 2022, he said he would support a bill introduced by Senator Lindsey Graham that would ban abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.


==== Budget and economy ====
Harris supports a federal balanced budget and opposes earmarks. He opposes increases to the debt ceiling without cuts to federal spending, and opposes increases to taxes and to the federal minimum wage. Harris supports eliminating tax deductions and implementing a flat tax.
In August 2013, Harris proposed using the debt ceiling to delay the Affordable Care Act's implementation by one year as opposed to voting to defund it. On October 16, 2013, Harris voted against the motion to end the government shutdown and raise the debt ceiling.
In March 2015, Harris proposed "shutting down the White House" by halving appropriations funding as opposed to a government shutdown.
In January 2018, Harris voted for a Senate stopgap funding bill to end the 2018–2019 United States federal government shutdown. In March 2018, he voted against the $1.3 trillion omnibus spending package, calling it "fiscally irresponsible".
In 2022, following a spike in gas prices as the result of the Russo-Ukrainian War, Harris supported efforts to extend Maryland's gas tax holiday until the end of the year.
In April 2023, Harris praised the Republican debt ceiling plan, which limited spending to pre-pandemic levels with one percent annual growth over a decade. He was among the 71 Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 in the House.


==== Education ====
During the 2001 legislative session, Harris introduced legislation to create a statewide program to provide state-funded scholarships to students attending private schools.


==== Environment ====
Harris has questioned whether human activities have contributed to climate change, but supports using technological developments, such as hydrogen cells and nuclear fusion, to tackle climate change. He also supports providing federal funding toward Chesapeake Bay cleanup efforts, having played an instrumental role in restoring $60 million in funding for the Chesapeake Bay cleanup program following earlier proposals that saw the program receive no funding.
In July 2017, Harris amended the 2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act to ban federal funding for any wind farms projects that were closer than 24 nautical miles to the coastline. The amendment was seen as a response to the Maryland Public Service Commission's approval of two wind farms off the coast of Ocean City, both of which were planned to be at least 17 miles from the shore; Harris claimed that the wind farms would be visible from the horizon and discourage tourism to Ocean City. He later called for the Ocean City wind farm project to be revisited, claiming that it would interfere with Coast Guard shipping channels and Department of Defense military communications. In 2023, after a dead humpback whale washed ashore Assateague Island, Harris called for a moratorium on wind farm construction, which he claimed without evidence was responsible for the whale's death.
In 2018, Harris said that he supported offshore drilling, but opposed offshore drilling off the coast of Maryland. In 2022, following a spike in gas prices as the result of the Russo-Ukrainian War, he said he supported restarting the Keystone pipeline to reduce gas prices. In 2023, Harris called for an increase in natural gas and coal production as a means to lower the national deficit and counter China's influence on global markets.
In 2019, Harris voted against rejoining the Paris Agreement. He also voted against the Coastal and Marine Economies Act, which would ban any new offshore drilling activity off the Pacific or Atlantic coasts.
Following the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse in March 2024, Harris called on state and federal officials to "immediately reduce the environmental and regulatory burdens" that would hamper reconstruction of the bridge.


==== Gun policy ====
Harris opposes restrictions on the right to carry, but says that citizens who commit or threaten to commit a crime with a firearm should receive harsh sentences. In 2017, he voted for the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, a bill that would require all states recognize concealed carry permits issued by other states.
During the 2000 legislative session, Harris opposed legislation that would require handguns sold in Maryland to have integrated mechanical safety devices.
In January 2016, Harris said he supported a proposal by presidential candidate Donald Trump to eliminate gun-free zones at schools, arguing that gun-free zones led to an increase in school shootings. After the Sutherland Springs church shooting on November 5, 2017, Harris compared gun control efforts to Nazi gun control measures, saying "Jews were not allowed to own guns in Nazi Germany and that didn't end well". In 2018, Harris said he supported arming teachers.
In 2022, Harris voted against a bill to ban assault weapons.


==== Healthcare ====
Harris supports Maryland's "high-risk pool" healthcare system, voting in 2002 for a bill creating the health insurance pool.
Harris opposes the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which he has called a "government takeover of health care", and ran in 2010 on a promise to repeal it. During a town hall meeting in August 2013, he criticized the ACA's individual mandate and employer mandates, which he said encouraged businesses to increase part-time hiring. Harris also said he supported protecting health insurance access for individuals with pre-existing conditions as well as removing caps on insurance benefits. In December 2013, he proposed using sequestration to increase the amount states would need to pay to expand Medicaid by 10 percent.
In 2013, Harris introduced a bill that would repeal a provision of the ACA that required insurance companies to cover procedures performed by chiropractors, midwives, and similar medical staff. He also cosponsored the HIV Organ Policy Equity Act, a bill that allowed HIV-infected people to donate their organs to other HIV-infected people, which was signed into law by President Barack Obama in November 2013.
In 2014, Harris said he supported an U.S. Department of Health and Human Services probe into glitches with Maryland's health insurance exchange, which was among the worst performing in the nation. The probe, which concluded in March 2015, found that the state lacked oversight and internal controls that led to the state improperly spending $28.4 million in federal funding.
Harris was initially supportive of the American Health Care Act of 2017 (AHCA), which would have partially repealed the ACA. He later said he would vote against the AHCA following last-minute changes made to the bill that he said "simply won't lower premiums as much as the American people need". Harris dismissed Congressional Budget Office estimates that showed that eliminating cost-sharing subsidies would cause insurance premiums to grow 20 percent, calling it "another excuse by insurance companies to raise premiums". In May 2017, Harris voted for the AHCA.
In September 2017, Harris said he supported the Graham–Cassidy health care amendment, which would have returned control of Medicaid back to the states. In October 2017, he said he supported the Trump administration's decision to end federal subsidies to help low-income people pay for out-of-pocket expenses under ACA.
In 2018, Harris said he supported raising the full retirement age for Social Security from 67 to 70 years old. He also said he supported imposing work requirements on "able-bodied adults" for Medicaid and food stamps.
In 2019, Harris voted against the Never Forget the Heroes Act, a bill authorizing permanent health benefits for first responders during the September 11 attacks. In 2022, he voted against the Federal Firefighters Fairness Act, which would have eased the compensation claim process for federally employed firefighters diagnosed with mesothelioma.


==== Immigration ====
Harris does not support a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, saying in August 2013 that "if you came here illegally, you should be very happy if what we do is just to allow you to remain and contribute to the economy illegally". He has also criticized amnesty as a "step back from the rule of law". Harris supports expanding H-2B visas for agricultural and seasonal industries as well as immigration policy of Donald Trump. In 2011, Harris co-signed a letter opposing a new U.S. Department of Labor rule to increase the hourly wages of H-2B visa workers.
In 2014, Harris said he supported instituting a travel ban on Ebola endemic areas.
In 2017, Harris said he supported Executive Order 13769, an executive order by President Donald Trump to temporarily suspend the United States Refugee Admissions Program and ban travel from six predominantly Muslim countries. He also supported the Trump administration's plan to phase out the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. In February 2019, he said he supported Trump's national emergency declaration to fund the construction of the Mexico–United States border wall, which he claimed would prevent drug trafficking, gang activity, and sexual violence. Later that year, Harris voted against blocking the emergency declaration and the American Dream and Promise Act, and voted for a bill to provide $4.6 billion in humanitarian aid for migrants at the Mexico–United States border.
In 2019, Harris criticized sanctuary city policies, saying that they "create an environment of the lack of rule of law".


==== LGBT rights ====
In 2001, Harris led a filibuster of a bill prohibiting discrimination against same-sex couples, which lasted more than two hours and ended after two-thirds of state senators voted to limit debate. He also unsuccessfully sought to amend the bill to allow people to discriminate on the basis of religion.
In 2006, Harris said he supported a proposed constitutional amendment to "protect marriage between a man and a woman", which he later cosponsored in 2013 and 2015.
Harris said he was disappointed with the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, which legalized gay marriage throughout the United States. In October 2014, the Human Rights Campaign placed Harris on its list of the 14 most "anti-equality" House members, citing his support for several anti-LGBT bills including one prohibiting on the use of Department of Defense property in gay marriages and another banning federal discrimination against people and organizations on the basis of religious beliefs. In 2015, he cosponsored a resolution disagreeing with the Supreme Court ruling in Obergefell.
In 2021, Harris voted against the Equality Act, a bill to add gender identity and sexual orientation to federal anti-discrimination laws. In 2022, he voted against the Respect for Marriage Act, which codified same-sex and interracial marriage rights.
In 2023, Harris voted for the Protection of Women and Girls Sports Act, a bill to ban transgender women from competing in female sports. He also opposed a proposed U.S. Department of Education rule requiring elementary schools to allow students to participate in school sports programs based on their stated gender identity. In July 2023, Harris voted to strip funding for LGBTQ projects from the 2024 United States federal budget, comparing its funding to a hypothetical Ku Klux Klan project because the "LGBTQ center organized a protest against conservative mothers".


==== Marijuana ====
In January 2003, Harris said he opposed legalizing medical marijuana in Maryland, saying that he preferred that the issue be handled at the federal level.
In 2014, Harris was the leading congressional critic of marijuana decriminalization in the District of Columbia bill, and led efforts in Congress to block decriminalization from taking effect. Harris's amendment led to a call from D.C. mayor Vincent Gray to boycott tourism to Harris's district and the boycott of Maryland's 1st congressional district, as well as an online campaign requesting that D.C.-area businesses refuse him service. Washington D.C. officials and marijuana activists called Harris's actions unwarranted congressional interference.
In November 2014, D.C. residents voted to legalize recreational cannabis for adults, with 68% in favor. Despite this, Harris said he would use "all resources available to a member of Congress to stop this action". On December 9, 2014, congressional leaders announced a deal on a spending bill that included language that would prohibit the D.C. referendum from taking effect. Harris said that "the Constitution gives Congress the ultimate oversight about what happens in the federal district." He said he believes that cannabis is a gateway drug.
In 2022, Harris added a provision to the $1.5 trillion spending omnibus package that barred D.C. from legalizing, regulating and taxing the sale recreational cannabis, overriding the will of D.C. voters. Democrats opposed Harris's provision, but Republicans sharply opposed attempts to remove the provision. In February 2024, amid federal efforts to lower the drug designation of marijuana from a schedule 1 substance to a schedule 3, Harris wrote to the Food and Drug Administration criticizing the agency for not "sufficiently examining the effect of daily marijuana use" and the impact of marijuana use on driving, pregnant women, and children.


==== Social issues ====
During the 2003 legislative session, Harris voted against a bill to impose a two-year moratorium on death penalty sentences.
In 2006, Harris voted in favor of a bill to legalize slot machine gambling in Maryland, but said he would only support a "limited plan" that required statewide and local referendums to legalize slots.
In April 2009, Harris led opposition to the scheduled screening of the pornographic film Pirates II: Stagnetti's Revenge at the University of Maryland, College Park, threatening to withhold state funding from the university if it showed the film. Following this threat, the university cancelled the screening of the film. After portions of the film were screened by students at the campus lecture hall, Harris unsuccessfully sought to amend the state budget to block funding for the University System of Maryland until it adopted a policy on showing pornographic material on campus, which was later watered down into a compromise requiring the university system to develop policies on what kind of films could be shown on campus, which he supported. In November 2009, the University System of Maryland Board of Regents unanimously voted against adopting a policy to restrict the screening of pornographic films on campus.
In 2010, Harris said he opposed the Park51 project, a proposal to build a mosque two blocks from the World Trade Center site of the September 11 attacks, calling it "blatantly disrespectful".
In 2016, Harris voted against renaming a post office in Winston-Salem, North Carolina after civil rights activist Maya Angelou, who he called a "communist sympathizer", citing her support for the Cuban Revolution.
In 2019, Harris voted against renewing the Violence Against Women Act.
In 2020, Harris voted against removing an expired congressional deadline for the adoption of the Equal Rights Amendment.
In 2020, Harris said he supported President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard in response to George Floyd protests. He voted against removing a marble bust of Justice Roger B. Taney from the U.S. Capitol, saying that while he supported proposals to add a bust of Justice Thurgood Marshall, he believed the Taney bust should remain as a "teaching moment".


==== Veterans ====
The PACT ACT which expanded VA benefits to veterans exposed to toxic chemicals during their military service, received a "nay" from Harris. Regarding cannabis, despite lobbying from VSOs such as the DAV Harris also voted against 2022 MORE Act.


=== Governance ===


==== COVID-19 response ====
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Harris opposed prohibitions on indoor dining during the COVID-19 pandemic and stay-at-home orders, and was skeptical of face masks. In March 2020, he voted for, and later criticized, the CARES Act. On May 2, 2020, Harris addressed protesters in Salisbury attempting to pressure Maryland governor Larry Hogan to lift restrictions, saying, "I am a physician. Let me tell you something: It is safe to begin to reopen Maryland." Harris also called on the state to partially reopen areas with low cases of COVID-19 and to lift restrictions on "low-risk businesses", such as golf courses and small businesses. In February 2021, Harris cosponsored a bill that would block state or local governments from receiving federal COVID-19 relief funds if they enacted restrictions affecting small businesses.
In August 2020, Harris promoted the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19, despite the lack of evidence for its effectiveness and the subsequent opposition from NIH and WHO to its use for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients.
In December 2020, Harris voted against a measure to raise stimulus checks sent out under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 to $2,000 per individual. In February 2021, he voted against the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.
Harris supported COVID-19 vaccination efforts, but opposed vaccine mandates. In March 2021, he led a letter to Acting United States secretary of health and human services Norris Cochran urging him to review the two-dose strategy used for Pfizer-BioNTech's and Moderna's COVID-19 vaccines, arguing that a single-dose plan would "save the lives of up to 40,000 American seniors". In July 2021, amid a surge in COVID-19 cases resulting from the delta variant, Harris urged constituents to get the COVID-19 vaccine.


==== Elections ====
In 2004, Harris criticized a state plan to use electronic voting machines in the 2004 general election and introduced a bill requiring voting machines to print voters' choices onto a paper ballot. He later unsuccessfully sued to block the state from using electronic voting machines during the 2004 elections. In 2006, Harris again criticized the state for using electronic voting machines in its 2006 elections, claiming without evidence that it would lead to voter fraud and suggesting that Iraq and Afghanistan "had more secure elections than Maryland does".
In 2008, Harris supported a bill that would require voters to show proof of citizenship to participate in Maryland elections.
In 2018, Harris introduced the Protecting Election Systems from Foreign Control Act, which would ban state election boards from contracting with foreign election systems vendors.
In October 2024, Harris suggested that the North Carolina legislature should pre-emptively override the popular vote results in the presidential election and award its electors to Donald Trump because of the impact that Hurricane Helene had on Republican-leaning districts.


===== 2020 presidential election =====
In August 2020, Harris dismissed accusations that U.S. postmaster general Louis DeJoy was attempting to undercut mail-in balloting, which he called a "conspiracy theory". He said he opposed using universal mail-in ballots to conduct the 2020 presidential election, claiming without evidence that it would "result in people who aren't qualified to have ballots getting them and in some cases people who are qualified not getting them". Harris later voted against a bill to increase U.S. Postal Service funding by $25 billion to help the agency prepare for the election.
After Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election and President Donald Trump refused to concede while making false claims of fraud, Harris defended Trump's efforts to overturn the election. Harris falsely claimed there were "large-scale voting irregularities" and "secret, unobserved vote counting in the swing states", and called on Attorney General William Barr to investigate "these crimes".
In December 2020, Harris was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.
In July 2022, the United States House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack revealed that Harris was present at a White House meeting with Republican House members on December 21, 2020, to discuss a plan to "encourage members of the public to fight the outcome on January 6". He confirmed his attendance to this meeting during a debate in October 2022, during which he said he would "take the invitation again" and added that it was "not planning an insurrection". Harris also said that he accepted the results of the 2020 presidential election at the debate, and called for national voter ID laws.
In September 2022, Harris voted against the Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act of 2022, a bill that made multiple revisions to the voting, certification, counting, and transition process in wake of the January 6 United States Capitol attack.


==== Impeachments ====
On October 31, 2019, Harris voted with his fellow Republicans in opposition to a resolution outlining rules for then-ongoing impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump. On December 18, 2019, he voted against both articles of impeachment of the first impeachment of President Trump.
Harris was one of four representatives who did not cast a vote regarding the second impeachment of President Trump on January 13, 2021. He tweeted that he opposed it, calling it divisive and a waste of time, and that he needed to be in the operating room caring for patients. During the 117th United States Congress, Harris cosponsored two different resolutions to impeach President Joe Biden. He also cosponsored a resolutions to impeach Attorney General Merrick Garland and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who he blamed for the United States' withdrawal from Afghanistan. Very early in the 118th Congress, Harris cosponsored a resolution to impeach Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas.


==== Redistricting ====

Harris supports using independent redistricting commissions to draw redistricting plans for federal offices, calling it the "biggest thing you could do to increase cooperation between the two parties". He has described himself as a beneficiary of gerrymandering, pointing to the 1st district's configuration as having been carved out to elect a Republican to Congress and get more Democrats elected elsewhere in Maryland. During his time in the Maryland Senate, Harris sought to pass legislation requiring Maryland to use an independent commission to redraw its districts.
During the 2020 redistricting cycle, the Maryland General Assembly redrew Maryland's congressional districts to make Maryland's 1st congressional district more competitive for Democrats by redrawing the 1st district from one that voted for Trump by 20 points to one where Biden slightly won in 2020, an effort that Harris opposed. He instead supported the maps drawn by Governor Larry Hogan's Maryland Citizens Redistricting Commission, an independent redistricting commission made up of three Democrats, Republicans, and Independent voters. In March 2022, Judge Lynne A. Battaglia struck down the Maryland General Assembly's new congressional districts as an "extreme partisan gerrymander", prompting legislators to pass a new congressional map that undid changes to make the 1st district more competitive.


==== Storming of the Capitol ====
In an interview with WBAL-TV just after evacuating the Capitol after it was stormed, Harris downplayed the violence of the riot, saying "Obviously, later we heard there was a gunshot, but other than that, there was no indication that this was a truly violent protest, as violent as one as you would worry about." Harris also said he understood the rioters' frustrations and repeated false claims of election fraud. During a debate in October 2022, he denied that the Capitol attack was an "insurrection", stating that the only people who had weapons during the attack were Capitol police officers.
On January 6, 2021, after the 2021 storming of the United States Capitol, Harris had a verbal altercation with Representative Al Lawson on the House floor after taking offense at Representative Conor Lamb's criticism of House Republicans for pushing unfounded conspiracy theories. During an interview the next day, Harris falsely claimed that leftist provocateurs were behind the storming of the Capitol.
In May 2021, Harris voted against a measure creating the January 6 commission, calling it "another partisan stunt from Speaker Pelosi".
In June 2021, Harris was among 21 House Republicans to vote against a resolution to give the Congressional Gold Medal to police officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on January 6, which he had called a "stunt".


=== Foreign policy ===
Harris supports increasing federal defense funding to combat threats to national security. In 2013, he said he supported cuts to the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to support expanding the military.
In 2015, Harris voted against the Trade Promotion Authority. In 2019, he voted for the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement, a successor to NAFTA.


==== Hungary ====

In 2018, Harris led a letter opposing a U.S. State Department plan to provide $700,000 for independent media in Hungary, which he charged as having "distorted the record" of Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán. In 2022, he praised Orbán's leadership in a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Hungary. In 2022, Harris was one of 63 Republicans to vote against a nonbinding resolution to support NATO, which he later defended by saying that the military alliance had "unfairly criticized the governments of Hungary and Poland", both of which are members of NATO.


==== Iran ====
In 2015, Harris said he opposed the Iran Nuclear Deal, which he said would go toward buying "weapons that will end up killing Americans at some point in the future". He later called for increased sanctions on Iran, including a ban on any nuclear enrichment in the country.


==== Israel ====
Harris supports Israel's right to defend itself and the Abraham Accords. He has criticized the European Union for funding what he called "illegal building" by the Palestinian National Authority in the Judea and Samaria Area, and suggested in December 2022 that the United States should provide funding to Israel for developing infrastructure in these areas. In November 2023, amid the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, Harris said he opposed providing humanitarian aid to Palestine and criticized the Biden administration for "interfering" with Israel's handling of the war.


==== Libya ====
In 2011, Harris voted to end the U.S. military presence in Libya and to limit the use of funds supporting NATO operations in Libya.


==== Myanmar ====
In 2021, Harris was one of 14 Republican representatives to vote against a measure condemning the Myanmar coup d'état.


==== Syria ====
In 2013, Harris said he opposed the American-led intervention in the Syrian civil war. In 2014, after the Obama administration carried out over 150 airstrikes on the Islamic State in Syria, he called for a new authorization vote on the U.S.-led intervention.
In April 2017, Harris said he supported the Trump administration's decision to launch airstrikes against the Syrian airfield believed to be responsible for the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack. He also supported the April 2018 missile strikes against Syria following the Douma chemical attack.
In 2019, Harris raised concerns over President Trump's withdrawal of troops from the Turkey-Syria border, but ultimately voted against condemning the withdrawal. In 2023, he was among 47 Republicans to vote in favor of H.Con.Res. 21, which directed President Joe Biden to remove U.S. troops from Syria within 180 days.


==== Turkey ====
In 2019, Harris was one of 16 House members to vote against imposing sanctions against Turkey for its invasion of northern Syria, and one of 11 House members to vote against recognizing the Armenian genocide.


==== Ukraine ====
Harris is supportive of congressional efforts to provide Ukraine with various forms of aid amid the Russo–Ukrainian War. In April 2022, he co-signed a letter to President Joe Biden urging him to extend temporary protected status to Ukrainian refugees who sought to enter the United States.
During a town hall meeting in August 2023, Harris suggested that the U.S. should begin winding down on aid to Ukraine and negotiating for the end of the war, pointing to the national deficit and the 2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive, which he deemed to be a failure.


=== Roy Moore ===
During the primary race of the 2017 special election to fill the Senate seat formerly held by Jeff Sessions, Harris endorsed Roy Moore in his primary campaign against the incumbent, Luther Strange. Following the news of sexual misconduct allegations against Moore, Harris said Moore should withdraw from the race if the allegations were true.


== Electoral history ==


== Personal life ==
Harris was married for 30 years to Sylvia "Cookie" Harris, who died of a heart attack on August 28, 2014. They had five children. In July 2017, he married Nicole Beus, a Baltimore County political and marketing consultant who serves as the chair of the Maryland Republican Party.
Harris lives in Cambridge on the Eastern Shore, having previously lived in Cockeysville, a suburb of Baltimore. He considered himself a "citizen-legislator," having maintained his medical practice while in the State Senate.
Harris has been an active member in the community as a member of the Knights of Columbus, an officer in the Thornleigh Neighborhood Improvement Association (vice president, 1984–85; president, 1985–86), a member of the Board of Directors of the Sherwood Community Association (1987–91), and vice president of St. Joseph's School Home-School Association from 1992 to 1994.

Harris received the Dr. Henry P. and M. Page Laughlin Distinguished Public Officer Award from the Medical and Chirurgical Faculty of Maryland in 2001.


=== 2021 gun incident ===
On January 21, 2021, Harris tried to enter the House floor with a gun, setting off a metal detector. This was in violation of new security measures adopted after the storming of the U.S. Capitol. Harris was not allowed to enter and returned 10 minutes later without a gun, at which point he was allowed entry. U.S. Capitol Police began an investigation into the incident.


=== Ivermectin prescriptions ===
In October 2021, Harris said on a radio show he prescribed ivermectin to constituents for treatment of COVID-19. Ivermectin is used to treat parasites in livestock and river blindness in humans. It is not approved by the FDA for treatment of COVID-19. During a discussion of vaccine mandates by the House Freedom Caucus in November 2021, Harris said that a complaint was filed against him with a physicians board for prescribing ivermectin.

William Patrick Huizenga ( HY-zing-gə; born January 31, 1969) is an American politician serving as a U.S. representative from Michigan since 2011, representing the state's 4th congressional district. A member of the Republican Party, Huizenga served in the Michigan House of Representatives from 2003 to 2009. His district, numbered as the 2nd from 2011 to 2023, covers much of Southwestern Michigan, including Kalamazoo, Battle Creek, and Holland.


== Early life ==
Born to a family of Dutch Americans, Huizenga is the co-owner and operator of Huizenga Gravel Company, a family business in Jenison, Michigan. In the early 1990s, he worked in real estate. He left real estate in 1996, becoming an aide to U.S. Representative Pete Hoekstra.


== Michigan House of Representatives ==
Starting with his first election in 2002, Huizenga represented the 90th district for three terms, winning reelection in 2004 and 2006. After the 2006 election he was term limited. The district is in Ottawa County and includes Holland, Zeeland, Hudsonville, Blendon Township, Jamestown Township, Holland Township, and Zeeland Township.
Huizenga voted for the initial version of the Michigan Business Tax, but opposed the 2% surcharge and a sales and services tax later in the process.


== U.S House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 2010 ====

After serving 18 years, Republican incumbent Pete Hoekstra retired to run for the Republican nomination for governor. Huizenga defeated Jay Riemersma, State Senator Wayne Kuipers, businessman Bill Cooper, and three others in the Republican primary election—the real contest in this heavily Republican district—on August 3, 2010. Huizenga defeated Democratic nominee Fred Johnson, 64% to 32%. The district was rated "Solid Republican" by The New York Times. The district and its predecessors have been in Republican hands for all but four years since 1873, and without interruption since 1935.


==== 2012 ====

Huizenga was reelected, defeating Democratic nominee Willie German Jr., Mary Buzuma of the Libertarian Party, Ronald Graeser of the U.S. Taxpayers Party and William Opalicky of the Green Party.


==== 2014 ====

Huizenga was reelected, defeating Democratic nominee Dean Vanderstelt, Ronald Welch of the Libertarian Party and Ronald Graeser of the U.S. Taxpayers Party.


==== 2016 ====

Huizenga was reelected, defeating Democratic nominee Dennis Murphy, Erwin Haas of the Libertarian Party, and Matthew Brady of the Green Party.


==== 2018 ====

Huizenga was reelected, defeating Democratic nominee Rob Davison and Ronald Graeser of the U.S. Taxpayers Party.


==== 2020 ====

Huizenga was reelected, defeating Democratic nominee Bryan Berghoef, Max Riekse of the Libertarian Party, Gerald Van Sickle of the U.S. Taxpayers Party, and Jean-Michel Creviere of the Green Party.


==== 2022 ====

For his first six terms, Huizenga represented much of Lake Michigan's eastern shore and many of Grand Rapids's suburbs, including Muskegon, Holland, Kentwood, and Grand Haven. However, redistricting after the 2020 census saw the district significantly redrawn. It was renumbered as the 4th district and pushed well to the south. It picked up Kalamazoo and Battle Creek while losing Muskegon, all of its share of Kent County and much of its share of Ottawa County. In the process, the district lost its connection to longtime Congressman Guy Vander Jagt, who represented the district (then numbered as the 9th) from 1967 to 1993.
The reconfigured district included much of the territory of the Kalamazoo-based 6th district, represented by 18-term incumbent and fellow Republican Fred Upton. Upton opted to retire, effectively handing the Republican nomination to Huizenga. The new 4th was no less Republican than the old 2nd, and Huizenga easily won a seventh term.


=== Tenure ===
In December 2020, Huizenga was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated incumbent Donald Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a statement that called signing the amicus brief an act of "election subversion." She also reprimanded Huizenga and the other House members who supported the lawsuit: "The 126 Republican Members that signed onto this lawsuit brought dishonor to the House. Instead of upholding their oath to support and defend the Constitution, they chose to subvert the Constitution and undermine public trust in our sacred democratic institutions."
As of January 2022, Huizenga has voted with President Biden's stated position roughly 14% of the time.


=== Committee assignments ===
Committee on Financial Services
Subcommittee on Capital Markets
Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations (Chair)


=== Caucus memberships ===

Huizenga voted against the Respect for Marriage Act codifying Loving v. Virginia and Obergefell v. Hodges, recognizing marriages across state lines regardless of "sex, race, ethnicity, or national origin of those individuals."
On healthcare, he describes himself as an opponent of Obamacare.
He opposes abortion and is a member of the Congressional Pro-Life caucus. He has voted to prevent federal tax money from being used for the procurement of abortions.


== Personal life ==
Huizenga and his wife have five children and live in Holland. He attends Haven Christian Reformed Church in Zeeland.

=== Michigan Senate (2019–2023) ===
Barrett was elected to the Michigan Senate in 2018, and in 2022 chaired the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.
Barrett was a vocal critic of Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, and sponsored Senate Bill 858 to regulate the governor's state of emergency powers, which the governor vetoed in May 2020.
Barrett was one of eleven state senators to sign a letter to Congress requesting, in January 2021, an "objective and transparent investigation into credible allegations of misconduct" in the 2020 presidential election.

John Edward James (born June 8, 1981) is an American businessman, combat veteran, and politician serving as the U.S. representative from Michigan's 10th congressional district since 2023. A member of the Republican Party, he was the party's nominee for U.S. Senate in 2018 and 2020.
In 2022, James declared his candidacy in Michigan's redrawn 10th congressional district. He defeated Democratic nominee Carl Marlinga. James was elected to a second term in 2024.


== Early life and military career ==
James was born in Southfield, Michigan, in 1981 and grew up Baptist in the Palmer Woods neighborhood of Detroit. He graduated from the Catholic Brother Rice High School in 1999. He graduated from the United States Military Academy (West Point) in 2004, and served eight years in the Army, participating in multiple tours of duty in Operation Iraqi Freedom as an AH-64 Apache pilot. Two of his West Point classmates are fellow congressmen Wesley Hunt and Pat Ryan. He attended Ranger School and became Ranger-tabbed as a captain.
James received a master's degree in supply chain management from Penn State University's Smeal College of Business and an MBA from the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business.


== Business career ==
In 2012, James joined James Group International, where his father, John A. James, was the CEO. James Group is a global supply chain management service company; James became its director of operations, and eventually became president of James Group International and CEO of its subsidiary, Renaissance Global Logistics. Renaissance Global, based in Detroit, was the recipient of a $1–2 million Paycheck Protection Program loan during the COVID-19 pandemic.
James was named one of Detroit Business Journal's 30 in their 30s of 2012, and Michigan Chronicle's 40 under 40 of 2014. He served as a board member of the Michigan Council for Future Mobility, Michigan Minority Supplier Development Council and National Veteran Business Development Council. He serves on the Detroit Workforce Development Board.


== Political career ==


=== 2018 U.S. Senate race ===

In September 2017, James entered the Republican primary for the 2018 United States Senate election in Michigan in an attempt to unseat three-term incumbent Democrat Debbie Stabenow, as well as become Michigan's first African-American senator. Despite musician and Michigan native Kid Rock publicly toying with the idea of running for the seat for months, the primary came down to James and Grosse Pointe businessman and former Wayne County commissioner Sandy Pensler. James was endorsed via Twitter by President Donald Trump on July 27, 2018, eleven days before the primary. James won the nomination with 55% of the vote.
On November 6, 2018, Stabenow defeated James, 52.3% to 45.8%.


=== Potential United Nations ambassadorship ===
In late November 2018, Bloomberg News reported that Trump was considering nominating James to become the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, to replace Ambassador Nikki Haley, who previously announced that she was planning to leave the Trump administration by the end of 2018. James reportedly met at the White House with Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. He was ultimately bypassed for the position. Trump announced he would appoint Heather Nauert, the spokesperson for the United States Department of State and a former television reporter, to succeed Haley, but Nauert was never nominated and announced in February 2019 that she was withdrawing from consideration.
After Nauert's withdrawal, Trump again considered James for the ambassadorship, but eventually nominated United States ambassador to Canada Kelly Knight Craft for the post.


=== 2020 U.S. Senate race ===

Because the election margin in the 2018 Senate race was smaller than expected, James became a front-runner for the Republican nomination to take on Michigan's other incumbent Democratic senator, Gary Peters, in the 2020 election.
As well as being recruited to take on Peters, it was reported in June 2019 that the National Republican Congressional Committee was recruiting James to challenge freshman Democratic U.S. representative Haley Stevens of Michigan's 11th congressional district.
On June 6, 2019, James announced that he was seeking the Republican nomination in 2020 to take on Peters. Michigan was one of two states in which an incumbent Democratic senator was seeking reelection during 2020 in a state won by Trump in 2016, the other being Alabama. Although the Associated Press called the race for Peters on November 4, 2020, James refused to concede, which Peters termed "pathetic." James initially insisted that the election had not been administered fairly. He established a joint legal fund with the Republican National Committee to challenge the results. James claimed there was "ample evidence" for an investigation, but offered none. He raised $2 million after the election as he sought to challenge the election results, and he unsuccessfully attempted to block certification of the results of the election, which he lost to Peters by 1.7% of the vote, which was much closer than originally projected. James conceded on November 24 over social media, congratulating Peters.
During his campaign, James pledged to give 5% of his campaign contributions to charity. The James fundraising committee reported about $46.12 million in total contributions for the 2020 election and has given more than $2.36 million to charities following through on his pledge.


== U.S House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 2022 ====

James won the Republican primary in the 2022 election in Michigan's 10th congressional district. He defeated Democrat Carl Marlinga in the November general election.


==== 2024 ====

James won a second term on November 5, 2024.


=== Committee assignments ===
As of the 118th Congress, James is a member of the following committees.

Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure
Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment (Vice Chair)
Subcommittee on Aviation
Committee on Foreign Affairs
Subcommittee on Africa (Chairman)
Subcommittee for Western Hemisphere
Committee on Education and the Workforce
Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Development
Committee on Energy and Commerce


== Political positions ==

During his 2018 Senate campaign, James ran on a typical Republican platform, describing himself on his campaign website as "a pro-life, pro-second amendment, pro-business conservative." He emphasized his desire to defund Planned Parenthood and compared Roe v. Wade, the United States Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion, to "genocide." He opposes the death penalty, does not believe employers should be able to fire workers due to their sexual orientation, and opposes the legalization of recreational marijuana.
James says he wants to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), which he has called "a monstrosity." According to The Detroit Free Press, James was careful not to take a position on the Trump administration's lawsuit seeking to immediately strike down the entire ACA as unconstitutional. When pressed in a September 2020 interview, he said he was against the ACA lawsuit without a replacement plan in place, but did not criticize Republicans for pushing the lawsuit.
James supported Ted Cruz in the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries. He later became a Trump supporter, and tweeted in 2018 that, if elected to the Senate, he would back Trump "2,000%." During his 2020 campaign, James accepted Trump's endorsement and campaigned alongside him. James has not been publicly critical of Trump or his actions. During a meeting with black faith leaders, James was asked whether he disagreed with Trump on anything. James said, "Everything from cutting Great Lakes funding to 'shithole countries' to speaking ill of the dead. I mean, where do you want to start?" In a leaked audio recording of a meeting with African American leaders in Michigan, James was asked why he hadn't publicly criticized Trump. He said he thought it was better to be silent in public in order to gain access to Trump. James said, "Donald Trump doesn't need less Black folks around him, he needs more," and that his goal was "achieving equity and equality for our people, not standing up on Twitter and condemning folks." During the campaign, Democrats sought to tie James to Trump, while James has said his candidacy was not a referendum on Trump.
During his 2020 campaign, James declined to take specific positions on a number of policy questions, including how the Social Security Trust Fund would be protected from the impact of a payroll tax cut, whether the Senate should vote to confirm a new Supreme Court justice to fill the vacancy created by the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg before or after the 2020 presidential election, and whether he thinks military bases named for Confederate generals should be renamed.


== Personal life ==
James married his wife, Elizabeth, in 2012. They have three sons. When James was still dating Elizabeth, he had an encounter with police at a mall in a suburb of Detroit in which the officers drew their guns on him; James believes that if Elizabeth had not been beside him, he might have been killed. He has also expressed his fear of being killed whenever police pull him over for a traffic stop.
James is a nondenominational Christian. He lives in Shelby Charter Township, Michigan.

Thomas Earl Emmer Jr. (born March 3, 1961) is an American attorney and politician who has served as majority whip in the United States House of Representatives since 2023. A member of the Republican Party, he has represented Minnesota's 6th congressional district since 2015.
Before his election to Congress, Emmer served three terms as a member of the Minnesota House of Representatives from 2005 to 2011. He lost the 2010 Minnesota gubernatorial election to Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party nominee Mark Dayton by less than half a percentage point. Emmer was elected to Congress in 2014, winning the 6th district seat being vacated by Michele Bachmann. He has been reelected four times. The district includes the far western and northern suburbs of Minneapolis in the Twin Cities metropolitan area, most of the St. Cloud metropolitan area, and a large part of rural Central Minnesota, generally an agricultural region.
Emmer chaired the National Republican Congressional Committee from 2019 to 2023. After Republicans gained a narrow-than-expected majority in the 2022 U.S. House of Representatives elections, he won a contested election for majority whip, 115-106.
Emmer initially cast doubt on the 2020 U.S. presidential election results, saying that certain states used "questionable" practices in administering the vote. After signing an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit seeking to contest the outcome in key swing states, Emmer ultimately voted to certify the Electoral College vote count.
Emmer was the House Republican Conference's third nominee for the October 2023 Speaker of the House election, after Steve Scalise withdrew and Jim Jordan failed to garner the votes needed in the first three ballots. He withdrew himself from the race shortly after former president Donald Trump voiced his opposition, calling him "totally out-of-touch with Republican Voters" and a "Globalist RINO".


== Early life, education ==
Emmer was born in South Bend, Indiana. His family later moved to Edina, Minnesota. He attended St. Thomas Academy, an all-male, Catholic, military, college-preparatory high school in Mendota Heights, near Saint Paul.
Emmer attended Boston College and the University of Alaska Fairbanks, graduating from the latter in 1984 with a Bachelor of Arts in political science. He played hockey for both schools. In 1988, Emmer received a Juris Doctor from William Mitchell College of Law in Saint Paul, Minnesota.


== Career ==
Emmer began his legal career representing cities and counties through the League of Minnesota Cities Insurance Trust and the League of Minnesota Counties Insurance Trust, handling lawsuits against police officers. He also represented volunteer firefighters and city and county inspectors, and handled a variety of land use issues. He was licensed to practice law in Minnesota, North Dakota, and Wisconsin.
Emmer served on city councils in Independence, Minnesota, and then in Delano, Minnesota.


=== Minnesota House of Representatives ===

In 2004, incumbent Republican State Representative Dick Borrell of Minnesota's House District 19B decided to retire. District 19B included portions of Wright and Hennepin Counties and the cities of Otsego, Albertville, St. Michael, Rockford, Delano, Montrose, and Waverly. Emmer, the Republican candidate, defeated Democrat Lori M. Schmidt, an attorney, 60%–40%, in the November 2004 general election.
In 2006, Emmer won reelection to a second term with 61% of the vote. In 2008, he was reelected to a third term with 61% of the vote. In 2010, he chose to run for governor of Minnesota rather than seek reelection.
During legislative sessions, Emmer regularly rode the bus to the Minnesota State Capitol. Emmer served on the Finance Committee, the Health Care and Human Services Policy and Oversight Committee, and the State and Local Government Operations Reform, Technology and Elections Committee. He was also a member of the Finance Subcommittee for the Health Care and Human Services Finance Division, and of the Health Care and Human Services Policy and Oversight Subcommittee for the Licensing Division.


=== 2010 gubernatorial election ===

Emmer officially announced his candidacy for governor of the State of Minnesota in July 2009. In January 2010, Emmer came in second to Marty Seifert in a non-binding straw poll of Republican Party caucus participants. In April 2010, Emmer announced that his running mate would be Metropolitan Council member Annette Meeks. Emmer received the endorsements of former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, Governor Tim Pawlenty, and Lieutenant Governor Carol Molnau. On April 30, 2010, the Republican Party of Minnesota officially endorsed Emmer as its candidate for governor at the state convention in Minneapolis. His main opponent, Marty Seifert, withdrew from the race and endorsed Emmer when it became apparent that Emmer was nearing the threshold for party endorsement. On August 10, 2010, Emmer won the Republican primary with 82% of the vote, a 75-point margin over Bob Carney.
The race attracted national attention as the "first case in this election cycle of a company hit by national protests over a campaign donation". Minnesota-based Target Corporation donated $150,000 to Minnesota Forward, a new political action committee paying for advertising that supported Emmer's gubernatorial election. Emmer said he viewed Target's donation as an exercise in free speech and wanted to keep his campaign focused on economic issues. Best Buy also donated $100,000 to Minnesota Forward.
The general election was contested by Emmer, former U.S. Senator Mark Dayton (DFL), and Independence Party candidate Tom Horner. Emmer trailed Dayton by 9,000 votes in the general election results, a margin small enough to trigger an automatic recount. Most analysts felt it was unlikely that the Emmer campaign could overcome such a deficit in a recount. After the recount made little difference, Emmer conceded the election on December 8, 2010.


=== Post-2010 election activities ===
Emmer was a registered lobbyist in Minnesota, and co-hosted a morning talk radio program with Bob Davis on KTLK in Minneapolis.
In early 2011, he ran for an open Minnesota seat on the Republican National Committee, but lost that election to Hennepin County Commissioner Jeff Johnson.
Emmer hosted a 2011 event promoting the launch of Representative Ron Paul's presidential campaign in Minnesota.

=== Elections ===


==== 2014 ====

Upon the surprise retirement of U.S. Representative Michele Bachmann, announced in May 2013, Emmer was considered a possible candidate for the Sixth Congressional District seat; his state house district included a large slice of the congressional district's western portion. On June 5, 2013, Emmer officially announced he would seek the Republican nomination for the seat. On February 4, 2014, Emmer received 67.9% of the vote in a 6th district straw poll. On April 12 he received the Republican Party endorsement for the nomination on the first ballot with 76%, but he still faced a primary challenge from his two competitors, Anoka County Board Chairwoman Rhonda Sivarajah and former state representative Phil Krinkie. Emmer was endorsed by the Tea Party Express, Young Americans for Liberty's Liberty Action Fund, and many Minnesota legislators. He won the primary with 73% of the vote, and easily prevailed in the November general election.


==== 2016 ====
In 2016 Emmer defeated Democratic nominee David Snyder, 66% to 34%.


==== 2018 ====
In 2018 Emmer defeated Democratic nominee Ian Todd, 61% to 39%.


==== 2020 ====

In 2020 Emmer defeated Democratic nominee Tawnja Zahradka 66% to 34%.


==== 2022 ====

In 2022 Emmer defeated Democratic nominee Jeanne Hendricks, 62% to 37%.


=== Tenure ===
According to the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University, Emmer held a Bipartisan Index Score of -0.0 in the 116th United States Congress for 2019, which placed him 192nd out of 435 members. Based on FiveThirtyEight's congressional vote tracker at ABC News, Emmer voted with Donald Trump's stated public policy positions 91.5% of the time, which ranked him average in the 116th United States Congress when predictive scoring (district partisanship and voting record) is used.
In October 2020, after it was determined that Emmer had interacted with individuals who tested positive for coronavirus in Washington D.C., such as Donald Trump, Emmer flew on a Delta flight in violation of the airline's rules, potentially exposing the other passengers to the virus.
On May 19, 2021, Emmer and the other seven Republican House leaders voted against establishing a national commission to investigate the January 6, 2021, attack on the United States Capitol Complex. Thirty-five House Republicans and all 217 Democrats present voted to establish such a commission.
In August 2021, Emmer released a statement about the resignation of Minnesota Republican Party chair Jennifer Carnahan after her ties with donor, strategist, and convicted sex trafficker Anton Lazzaro became a national news story. Emmer had previously received a $15,600 donation from Lazzaro, which Emmer said he would donate to charity.
On November 15, 2022, after Republicans gained the House majority, Emmer was elected Majority Whip. He won what was reportedly the conference's closest race, beating Drew Ferguson on the first ballot and Jim Banks on the second by a 115–106 vote.


==== October 2023 Speaker election ====

On October 20, 2023, it was reported that Emmer was considering a bid for Speaker of the House and making calls to gather support. He has been endorsed by former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who said, "He is the right person for the job. He can unite the conference. He understands the dynamics of the conference. He also understands what it takes to win and keep a majority." On October 24, the Republican conference nominated Emmer for the speaker candidateship, but he dropped out the same day following opposition from hardliners and former president Donald Trump. He was replaced by Mike Johnson, who later won the speakership.


=== Committee assignments ===
For the 118th Congress:

Committee on Financial Services
Subcommittee on Capital Markets
Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology and Inclusion


=== Caucus memberships ===
Republican Main Street Partnership
Republican Study Committee
Congressional Coalition on Adoption
Congressional Caucus on Turkey and Turkish Americans
Rare Disease Caucus


== Political positions ==


=== Abortion ===
Emmer is anti-abortion. He has an A+ rating from Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, and opposes the use of taxpayer dollars for abortion purposes.


=== BPA ===
In 2009, Emmer voted against legislation to prohibit sales of any children's product containing Bisphenol-A (except for used children's products). He said he voted against the law because of fear of "increased costs." "As well-intentioned as people may be," he said, "they don't think about what this vote means five steps down the line".


=== Bullying ===
During an October 9, 2010, televised debate, Emmer said he would oppose legislation to combat school bullying against gay and lesbian young people. Emmer, who voted against anti-bullying legislation as a state lawmaker, said that teachers are most responsible for halting bullies, but suggested that the threat of lawsuits keeps them from doing so. "I don't think we need more laws; I think we need more understanding," he said.


=== Climate and environment ===
As a state representative, in 2007 Emmer called climate science "Al Gore's climate porn", referring to Gore's documentary An Inconvenient Truth.
Emmer co-sponsored a 2022 nonbinding resolution in support of domestic oil and gas production, which did not pass. The proposal urged the House to "support the safe and responsible development of its energy resources via drilling".
The environmental advocacy League of Conservation Voters has given Emmer a lifetime score of 5%, the lowest in Minnesota's congressional delegation. Recent votes improved his 2021 score to 21%, compared to the U.S. House average of 57%.


=== Copper nickel mining in northern Minnesota ===
In 2018, Emmer supported two copper nickel mines in the Superior National Forest. As of 2019, they were planned by Polymet, which is owned by Switzerland-based mining giant Glencore, and Twin Metals, which is owned by Antofagasta, a Chilean mining company controlled by the Luksics, one of Chile's wealthiest families.
When the Department of Interior did not list copper or nickel as two of 35 "critical minerals" essential to national security in 2018, Emmer released a press release of a letter he wrote to Department of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke requesting that copper and nickel be included.
Emmer and Representative Pete Stauber both stood beside Assistant Secretary of the Interior Joseph Balash as he signed leases permitting Twin Metals to explore a large area of national forest land nine miles southeast of Ely for copper-nickel reserves on May 15, 2019. The Obama administration had mothballed the lease renewal pending an environmental review, but Twin Metals is now in possession of a 10-year lease to explore the area, with a view toward opening a mine there.


=== Cryptocurrency and digital assets ===
Tom Emmer is an outspoken proponent of cryptocurrency and digital assets. He introduced the bipartisan Securities Clarity Act in an effort to establish regulatory clarity for digital assets. In March 2023, after the collapse of crypto-friendly Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank, he cosigned a bipartisan letter to FDIC Chairman Martin J. Gruenberg inquiring about the alleged weaponization of banking instability to purge legal crypto companies from the banking system.
In June 2023, Emmer cosponsored the SEC Stabilization Act, which would effectively fire U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Gary Gensler. The legislation was not considered likely to win Congressional approval. It was introduced a week after the SEC sued Coinbase and Binance, claiming they failed to register as a national securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency.
After endorsing Donald Trump for president in 2024, Emmer said, "If the second Trump administration takes place, [the] president will be a lot more friendly to the crypto industry". Industry advocates say their efforts to develop regulations are nonpartisan.


=== Drunk driving ===
In 2009, Emmer sponsored a bill that would shorten the period of license revocation for driving under the influence and for refusing to take a field sobriety test. Additionally, though "suspected drunken drivers [currently] face revocation before they go to court," Emmer's bill would have delayed revocations until after conviction. Supporters of Emmer's bill said "it's needed because pre-conviction revocations penalize drivers before proving they're guilty." Mothers Against Drunk Driving and the head of the Minnesota DWI task force opposed the legislation because it would allow arrested drivers to continue to drive during the time between their arrest and hearing.
Emmer's own history became an issue in relation to his bill. At age 20, Emmer received a driving under the influence-related ticket. In 1991, at age 30, he pleaded guilty to careless driving while two charges for DWI and a license-plate violation were dropped. Emmer denied that his own drunk driving and legal consequences played a part in the bill, stating, "We all come to the Legislature with life experiences, but it has nothing to do with this bill." Emmer also said that his sentence in 1981 should have been harsher, because in that case he "probably wouldn't have taken the second chance" that led to his subsequent arrests and guilty plea in 1991.
On May 13, 2010, Emmer was one of three legislators not to vote on a bill that would have provided such tougher penalties for drunk drivers. He said he missed the vote when a previously scheduled lunch ran long, and that he had "no idea" how he would have voted on the bill, but that he "assume[d]" he would have supported it.


=== "Fire Pelosi" machine gun video ===
In an October 2022 CBS News television interview, Emmer was challenged for posting a video on Twitter that showed him firing a fully automatic machine gun with the caption "#FIREPELOSI". As chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), Emmer led 2022 election efforts to win a majority and replace House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The post occurred just days before the home invasion and attack on Pelosi's husband in California.


=== Healthcare ===
Emmer favors repealing the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). After supporting the March 2017 version of the American Health Care Act (a bill to repeal the ACA), he voted for it on May 4, 2017, before it had been scored by the Congressional Budget Office to determine its economic impact.


=== Minimum wage ===
In 2005, as a state representative, Emmer introduced an amendment that would have eliminated Minnesota's minimum wage law.


=== Immigration ===
Emmer supported President Donald Trump's 2017 executive order to temporarily curtail immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries until better screening methods are devised, saying, "Everybody needs to take a deep breath. There is no litmus test based on religion. The administration and I understand it has — takes the seven countries identified by the Obama administration, not this administration, as the most dangerous countries when it comes to potential terrorists."


=== Israel ===
Emmer voted to provide Israel with support following the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.


=== Pharmacy conscience clause ===
Emmer has supported "conscience clause" legislation that would allow pharmacists to refuse to dispense contraception on the basis of "ethical, moral or legal grounds as long as the pharmacist notifies their employer in advance and the employer can ensure a patient has timely access to the drug or device".


=== Same-sex marriage ===
Emmer supported a state constitutional amendment banning civil recognition of same-sex marriage or its legal equivalent, stating, "I believe marriage is the union between one man and one woman." In March 2007, Emmer introduced HF 1847, an amendment to the Minnesota Constitution "recognizing as marriage or its legal equivalent only a union between one man and one woman." Voters later rejected 2012 Minnesota Amendment 1.
Emmer was among 47 Republican Representatives who voted in favor of the Respect for Marriage Act, which codified the right to same-sex marriage in federal law.


=== Nullification ===
In 2010 Emmer sponsored an amendment to the Minnesota Constitution that would allow the state to nullify federal laws.


=== Taxes ===
Emmer strongly opposes tax increases. He has also proposed gradually reducing the state corporate tax, with the eventual goal of repealing it altogether.


=== Texas v. Pennsylvania ===
In December 2020, Emmer was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated incumbent Donald Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a statement that called signing the amicus brief an act of "election subversion." She also reprimanded Emmer and the other House members who supported the lawsuit: "The 126 Republican Members that signed onto this lawsuit brought dishonor to the House. Instead of upholding their oath to support and defend the Constitution, they chose to subvert the Constitution and undermine public trust in our sacred democratic institutions."


=== Trump felony conviction ===
When former president Trump was convicted of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, Emmer said, "Democrats just pulled off the biggest sham in U.S. history". Emmer serves as Trump's Minnesota campaign chair. He joined other Republican leaders in condemning Trump's conviction and appeared with other Republican leaders, promising "to use House oversight powers and other measures to target jurisdictions pursuing prosecutions of the former president."


=== "Tip credit" ===
On July 5, 2010, after visiting a restaurant in St. Paul, Emmer was asked during a press conference if he supported a tip credit, the policy of allowing businesses to subtract tips from a server's hourly wage. His response was "Yes... if you didn't have a minimum wage law", adding, "somebody could be taking home well over one hundred thousand dollars as a server" while the restaurant owner could be making much less.
One week after that press conference, Emmer announced a proposal that would exempt the first $20,000 a server makes in tips from state taxes. At the same press conference a protester dumped $20 in pennies on Emmer's lap.


=== Vote to defund vice president ===
On November 8, 2023, Emmer joined 100 other Republicans voting in favor of an amendment to a large appropriations bill that would prohibit funding for the Office of Vice President Kamala Harris.


== Controversies ==


=== Allegations of antisemitism ===
In 2019, Emmer sent a fundraising letter that critics alleged included antisemitic canards. The letter claimed that "left-wing radicals essentially BOUGHT control of Congress for the Democrats" and that three Jewish billionaires (Michael Bloomberg, Tom Steyer and George Soros) "bought" control of Congress for Democrats.
Emmer vigorously rejected the allegations, and numerous Republicans pushed back against them, including Matt Brooks of the Republican Jewish Coalition, who argued, "Firstly, Tom Steyer isn’t even Jewish; he's a practicing Episcopalian. Secondly, people can't simply be shielded from criticism because they're Jewish, not when otherwise similar people are criticized for the same exact actions. If it's fair to criticize the Kochs, like leading Democrat presidential candidates have done, then it's fair to criticize the top Democratic funders."


== Personal life ==
In 1910, Emmer's great-grandfather and his two brothers founded Emmer Brothers Lumber. It is now called Viking Forest Products and is employee-owned. Viking Forest Products is a subsidiary of Forest City Trading Group, one of the nation's largest wholesalers of forest products.
Emmer has seven children with his wife, Jacqueline, whom he married in 1986. He is a hockey player and coach. Emmer is a Roman Catholic.

Appearances on C-SPAN
---
Michelle Louise Helene Fischbach ( FISH-bahk; née St. Martin; born November 3, 1965) is an American attorney and politician who is the U.S. representative from Minnesota's 7th congressional district. The district, which is very rural, is Minnesota's largest by area and includes most of the western part of the state. A Republican, Fischbach served as the 49th lieutenant governor of Minnesota from 2018 until 2019. As of 2025, she is the last Republican to have held statewide office in Minnesota.
Fischbach was a member of the Minnesota Senate from 1996 to 2018, serving as president of that body from 2011 to 2013 and from 2017 to 2018. When Governor Mark Dayton appointed Tina Smith to the U.S. Senate following Al Franken’s resignation, Fischbach was elevated to the office of lieutenant governor, as required by the Minnesota Constitution.
While serving as the incumbent lieutenant governor of Minnesota, Fischbach was former Governor Tim Pawlenty's nominee for lieutenant governor in the Minnesota Republican Party primary during the 2018 Minnesota gubernatorial election. Pawlenty and Fischbach lost the primary election to Jeff Johnson.
In the 2020 U.S. House elections, Fischbach defeated 30-year DFLer incumbent Collin Peterson.


== Early life, education and career ==
Fischbach grew up in Woodbury, Minnesota. After graduating from Woodbury High School, she attended the College of St. Benedict in St. Joseph from 1984 to 1986; she later transferred to St. Cloud State University, where she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science and economics in 1989. Fischbach earned her Juris Doctor from William Mitchell School of Law in Saint Paul in 2011.
She first got involved in politics as an intern to Rudy Boschwitz, then a U.S. senator for Minnesota.
In 1994, Fischbach became the first woman elected to the Paynesville City Council, where she served until she was elected to the Minnesota Senate in 1996.


== Minnesota Senate ==
Fischbach was elected to the Minnesota Senate in 1996 in a special election held after the resignation of DFL Senator Joe Bertram, who had recently pleaded guilty to shoplifting. Fischbach was reelected months later in the 1996 general election, and in 2000, 2002, 2006, 2010, 2012, and 2016. She served as an assistant minority leader from 2001 to 2002 and from 2007 to 2008, and as a deputy minority leader from 2009 to 2010. Fischbach also served as the chair of the Senate's higher education committee.
In 2011, after an election in which Senate Republicans won a majority for the first time since party designation, Fischbach's colleagues elected her the first female president of the Minnesota Senate, a post she held until Republicans lost their majority in 2013. After Republicans regained a majority following the 2016 election, Fischbach was again elected Senate president on January 3, 2017.


== Lieutenant governor of Minnesota ==


=== Succession ===
On December 13, 2017, Governor Mark Dayton appointed his lieutenant governor, Tina Smith, to the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Al Franken, who resigned over allegations of sexual misconduct. Smith resigned to accept the appointment on January 2, 2018. Per Article V of the Minnesota Constitution, as president of the State Senate, Fischbach automatically ascended as lieutenant governor. 


=== Constitutional dispute ===
 
Fischbach acknowledged that she was now lieutenant governor, but maintained she would retain her Senate seat, calling herself "acting lieutenant governor." The constitutionality of holding two offices at once was disputed. Fischbach noted a memo from the Senate's nonpartisan counsel, which cited an 1898 decision by the Minnesota Supreme Court as legal precedent for her to hold both offices. She also said the lieutenant governor's duties are largely ceremonial and she would have no difficulty holding both offices. She declined the lieutenant governor's salary, opting to receive only the pay of a state senator. An advisory opinion from state attorney general Lori Swanson disputed the legality of Fischbach's holding both offices at once, citing a constitutional amendment passed in 1972, and other historical precedents.
The potential outcomes were seen as having potentially significant ramifications on Minnesota politics, as Republicans held only a two-vote majority in the state Senate. In December 2017, to avoid a potential tie should Fischbach resign her Senate seat, Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka and House Speaker Kurt Daudt sent Dayton a letter requesting a special legislative session to temporarily elect a Democratic president of the Senate. Dayton and legislative Democrats immediately rejected the idea, with Senate Minority Leader Tom Bakk indicating he would file a lawsuit to attempt to force Fischbach out of the Senate should she attempt to serve in both offices, saying the senate's "balance of power [...] will be up for grabs."
In January 2018, a constituent and local DFL activist filed suit against Fischbach, asking a Ramsey County District Court judge to remove her from the state Senate. In February 2018, a judge dismissed the suit, ruling it had been prematurely filed.
On May 25, 2018, Fischbach resigned from the Senate and was sworn in as lieutenant governor.


=== Campaign ===
In May 2018, former Republican Governor Tim Pawlenty announced Fischbach as his running mate in his bid for a third term. Pawlenty and Fischbach were defeated in the Republican primary by Jeff Johnson and Donna Bergstrom.
Fischbach was succeeded as lieutenant governor by Democratic State Representative Peggy Flanagan, who ran on a ticket with Tim Walz. Fischbach left office on January 7, 2019, after Walz and Flanagan were sworn in.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 2020 ====

On September 3, 2019, Fischbach announced her candidacy for the Republican nomination to challenge 30-year incumbent Democrat Collin Peterson in Minnesota's 7th congressional district. She won the five-way Republican primary election. Despite Peterson's incumbency, the 7th had been trending Republican for some time. The Republican presidential nominee had carried the district by double-digit margins in three of the last five elections. This included 2016, when Donald Trump carried it with 62 percent of the vote, his best showing in Minnesota and one of Trump's best performances in a district held by a Democrat.
During her campaign, Fischbach pledged to back Trump on trade, make the 2017 tax cuts permanent, and support workforce education and additional relief for rural and agricultural businesses affected by COVID-19. Her campaign emphasized her support for farmers and the Second Amendment, opposition to abortion, and support for strengthening the U.S. border.
Fischbach defeated Peterson by 49,226 votes, the largest margin of any Republican who defeated an incumbent Democrat in 2020. In that same election, Trump carried the 7th with 64 percent of the vote, his best showing in the state. She and Mariannette Miller-Meeks of Iowa are the only Republican members of Congress to flip Democratic House districts that were not held by Republicans before 2018.


=== Tenure ===
On January 7, 2021, Fischbach was one of 139 representatives to object to the certification of electoral votes from Arizona and Pennsylvania in the 2020 U.S. presidential election, citing allegations of irregularities and voter fraud. On January 13, 2021, she voted against the second impeachment of Trump.

== Personal life ==
Fischbach is Roman Catholic. She met her husband, Scott, while working on a campaign for former U.S. Senator Rudy Boschwitz. They started dating while she was attending St. Cloud State University and eventually moved to nearby Paynesville. When Fischbach ran for Congress she still lived in Paynesville, in the far southern corner of the congressional district. She and her family have since moved to Regal, near Willmar. They have two children and several grandchildren.
Fischbach's husband has served as executive director of Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life since 2001.

Peter Allen Stauber (born May 10, 1966) is an American politician, former professional hockey player, and retired law enforcement officer from Minnesota serving as the United States representative for Minnesota's 8th congressional district. A member of the Republican Party, Stauber has represented the district since 2019.
Stauber was born and grew up in Duluth, Minnesota. He played college hockey for Lake Superior State University, where as a star player on the team, he led the Lakers to a national championship in the 1988 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament. Stauber met his political idol President Ronald Reagan when the team visited the White House after winning the national championship. He later said this event formed his political ambition. He went on to have a brief career in professional hockey. Stauber served as a lieutenant in the Duluth Police Department from 1995 to 2017. During his service as a police officer, he was shot while on duty. He also served as a county commissioner in St. Louis County, Minnesota, from 2013 to 2019.
Stauber succeeded DFL incumbent Rick Nolan by defeating Democratic nominee Joe Radinovich in the 2018 United States House of Representatives elections. Representing a working-class and mostly rural district, Stauber is only the second Republican to represent his district since 1947.


== Early life and education ==
Stauber was born on May 10, 1966, in Duluth, Minnesota. He and his brothers, John, Jamie, Bill, Dan and Robb, all played hockey at various levels, but only Robb played in the National Hockey League (NHL). Stauber attended Denfeld High School in Duluth and graduated from Lake Superior State University with a bachelor's degree in criminology.


== Hockey career ==


=== College ===

Stauber was a star player for the Lake Superior State Lakers. He is credited with helping lead the Lakers to victory in the playoffs and the 1988 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Championship game. Lake Superior "became the smallest school ever to win college hockey's biggest prize." In that game, Stauber took a critical shot, described by opinion columnist Mike Mullen during Stauber's 2018 candidacy for the U.S. House of Representatives as "risky, arguably crafty, and inarguably illegal," and by Star Tribune sportswriter John Gilbert in his 1988 story on the championship game as the moment when "Pete Stauber got away undetected when he straight-armed the net off its moorings during a Saints rush with 1:23 to go in regulation."
After winning the national championship, the team was invited to the White House, where Stauber met President Ronald Reagan, an event he has called a pivotal moment in the formation of his interest in politics.


=== Professional ===
In 1990, Stauber signed a multi-year contract with the Detroit Red Wings. He played three seasons with affiliate club Adirondack Red Wings in the American Hockey League (AHL), and played 25 regular season games with the Toledo Storm in the ECHL, as well as a successful Riley Cup play-off run during the 1991–92 season. The Florida Panthers selected him from the Red Wings in the 1993 NHL expansion draft. However, due to a longstanding neck injury, he announced his retirement and joined the Duluth Police Department, where he served for 23 years.

==== 2018 ====

In June 2018, Donald Trump campaigned for Stauber during his run for U.S. Representative, making his first visit to Minnesota as president and attending his first rally to support a Republican candidate for the House of Representatives in the 2018 general election, visiting Stauber's hometown of Duluth. At the time, Stauber had been involved in local politics, serving since 2013 as a member of the St. Louis County, Minnesota Commission (which includes Duluth). He had also served on the Hermantown City Council for eight years.
The 8th district had an open seat in a previously Democratic-Farmer-Labor (DFL)-held district where the last two elections were close. Partisan funders on both sides of the aisle reserved "millions" of dollars for advertising in a race widely regarded as a potential Republican pickup of a seat that had been held since 2013 by Rick Nolan. In November, Stauber defeated the DFL nominee, former Nolan aide Joe Radinovich, to become only the fifth person to represent the district in 71 years, and the second Republican to do so. He won primarily by running up his margins in the district's more conservative western portion.
During his 2018 campaign, Stauber ran on a policy of allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, becoming only one of a handful of Republicans to endorse what was primarily a progressive idea. Stauber has since walked back from his campaign pledge.


==== 2020 ====

Stauber was reelected on November 4, 2020, defeating DFL nominee Quinn Nystrom, becoming the first Republican in 76 years to be reelected in the 8th district. In December 2020, he filed a motion to support Texas v. Pennsylvania, described as a "seditious abuse of the judicial process" and aimed at invalidating millions of votes in various swing states. The Duluth News Tribune, which had endorsed Stauber, and many other local officials sharply criticized him for the ploy in an open letter.


==== 2022 ====

Stauber was reelected on November 8, 2022, defeating DFL nominee Jennifer Schultz.


=== Tenure ===
According to the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University, Stauber held a Bipartisan Index Score of 0.7 in the 116th United States Congress for 2019, which placed him 64th out of 435 members. Based on FiveThirtyEight's congressional vote tracker at ABC News, Stauber voted with Donald Trump's stated public policy positions 90.4% of the time, which ranked him average in the 116th United States Congress when predictive scoring (district partisanship and voting record) is used.
On September 30, 2020, Stauber hosted Trump in a visit to his district, attending a rally of about 3,000 people at the Duluth International Airport. Along with two of his Minnesota Republican House colleagues, Stauber rode with Trump on Air Force One. After it was determined that Stauber had interacted with people who tested positive for COVID-19 in Washington D.C., including Trump, Stauber took a Delta flight in violation of Delta's rules, potentially exposing the other passengers to the virus.
In December 2020, Stauber was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated Trump.
A group of Ojibwe tribes from Stauber's district rebuked him for his attempts to block President Biden's nomination of Deb Haaland as United States Secretary of the Interior. The Midwest Alliance of Sovereign Tribes also complained about his actions. A member of the House subcommittee on Indigenous Peoples, Stauber cited Haaland's support of the Green New Deal and opposition to oil drilling. As a member of the House, he did not vote on the nomination.
During the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives election in January 2023, Stauber consistently voted for Kevin McCarthy. In October 2023, he voted against removing McCarthy as speaker, which was unsuccessful and resulted in another election. Stauber backed Jim Jordan on the first ballot and Bruce Westerman on the next two ballots before voting for Mike Johnson on the fourth and final ballot. In December 2023, he was among the 105 Republicans who voted to expel George Santos from the House.
In April and May 2023, Stauber introduced a resolution and bill to end mineral withdrawal in Ely, Minnesota, as a response to a moratorium the Biden administration enacted the previous year. In April 2024, the House of Representatives passed Stauber's bill, 212–203. It is unlikely to pass the Democratic–controlled Senate, and the White House has publicly voiced its opposition to it.

Their eldest son, Levi, plays as a forward for the Michigan Tech Huskies.
Stauber and his brothers run the Stauber Brothers Military Heroes Hockey Camp, a summer program for children with parents in the military. The six co-own the Duluth Hockey Company, which began as a sporting goods retailer but since 2015 has specialized in hockey-related merchandise. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the company received over $86,000 in relief funds from the Paycheck Protection Program.
As one of his sons has Down syndrome, Stauber has advocated for continuing medical research of the genetic disorder. He received the Quincy Jones Exceptional Advocacy Award from the Global Down Syndrome Foundation in 2023.
While on police duty in 1995, Stauber was shot and lightly wounded in the head when a bullet entered his squad car.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 2015 special election ====

After the death of Republican Congressman Alan Nunnelee in 2015, Kelly entered the race to succeed him. Nunnelee's widow, Tori Nunnelee, contributed to Kelly's campaign.
In the first round, Kelly finished second in a 13-candidate field, behind Democrat Walter Zinn. As no candidate received a majority of votes, Kelly and Zinn advanced to a runoff on June 2. Several of the other candidates in the race endorsed Kelly after they were eliminated.
In the heavily Republican district, Kelly took 70% of the vote to Zinn's 30%.

==== 2017 congressional baseball shooting ====

On June 14, 2017, in Alexandria, Virginia, Republican member of Congress and House Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana was shot while practicing for the annual Congressional Baseball Game for Charity, scheduled for the following day. Also shot were David Bailey and Crystal Griner, a Capitol Police officer assigned to protect Scalise; Zack Barth, a congressional aide; and Matt Mika, a Tyson Foods lobbyist.
A ten-minute shootout ensued between the shooter—James Hodgkinson of Belleville, Illinois, a left-wing activist—and officers from the Capitol and Alexandria Police. Media reports state Hodgkinson began firing from the fence adjacent to the third base dugout. At the time of the shooting, Kelly was playing third base and roughly ten yards from Hodgkinson. As Hodgkinson opened fire, Kelly is reported to be the first person to be shot at and the first to alert the rest of the team there was an active shooter by yelling "shooter, active shooter" as he evacuated himself from the field. Officers shot Hodgkinson, who died from his wounds later that day at George Washington University Hospital. Scalise and Mika were taken to nearby hospitals, where they underwent surgery. Scalise is the first sitting member of Congress to have been shot since Representative Gabby Giffords was shot in 2011.

Michael Patrick Guest (born February 4, 1970) is an American attorney and Republican politician. He has represented Mississippi's 3rd congressional district in the United States House of Representatives since 2019. He became the ranking member of the United States House Committee on Ethics upon the August 2022 death of Jackie Walorski, and became its chair in the 118th Congress after Republicans won a House majority that November.


== Early life and education ==
Michael Patrick Guest was born on February 4, 1970. He graduated from Mississippi State University with a bachelor's degree in accounting and the University of Mississippi School of Law with a Juris Doctor.

Guest and his family are members of Brandon Baptist Church, where he serves as a deacon and Sunday school teacher.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 2018 ====

Guest ran for the United States House of Representatives in Mississippi's 3rd congressional district to succeed Gregg Harper, who chose not to seek reelection. In the six-way June Republican primary election, Guest received the most votes (45%), with Whit Hughes coming in second with 22%. Because no candidate received 50% of the vote, Guest and Hughes faced each other in a primary runoff election, which Guest won. Guest defeated State Representative Michael Evans, the Democratic nominee, in the general election.
Guest campaigned as a strong supporter of President Donald Trump.


==== 2020 ====

Guest was reelected in 2020 with 64.7% of the vote, defeating Democrat Dort Benford.


=== Tenure ===

Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.
On May 19, 2021, Guest was one of 35 Republicans who joined all Democrats in voting to approve legislation to establish the January 6, 2021 commission meant to investigate the storming of the U.S. Capitol.
In November 2021, Business Insider reported that Guest had violated the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act of 2012, a federal transparency and conflict-of-interest law, by failing to properly disclose trades in BP and ExxonMobil stock by his wife's family trust; as a result, Guest paid a $200 fine.
In June 2022, after a leaked decision by the Supreme Court of the United States to revoke the right to abortion in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, Guest wrote to the Department of Homeland Security to demand action in the wake of attacks by Jane's Revenge, which Guest called an "anarchist extremist group" that targets crisis pregnancy centers and other anti-abortion organizations.
In August 2022, Guest was named ranking member of the House Ethics Committee upon the death of former ranking member Jackie Walorski.
Guest was among the 71 Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 in the House.
Guest voted to support Israel following the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.
He also proposed the resolution that expelled George Santos from Congress.
In 2024, Guest voted against the $60 billion military aid package for Ukraine, although much of the money would go to his constituency.

Ann Louise Wagner (née Trousdale, September 13, 1962) is an American politician and former diplomat serving as the U.S. representative for Missouri's 2nd congressional district. A member of the Republican Party, she was the United States ambassador to Luxembourg from 2005 to 2009.
Her district, based in St. Louis County, is heavily suburban and the state's wealthiest. It includes most of St. Louis's southern and western suburbs as well as some of the northern exurbs in St. Charles County and the northern part of Jefferson County. Before her diplomatic post, Wagner chaired the Missouri Republican Party from 1999 until 2005; she co-chaired the Republican National Committee for four years, starting in 2001. She is generally regarded as being part of the moderate bloc of her party.


== Early life and education ==
Wagner was born and raised in St. Louis. Her parents owned two carpet stores where she worked growing up. She attended Cor Jesu Academy, a private Catholic all-girls school in South County, and graduated from the University of Missouri in 1984 with a BSBA from the business school with an emphasis in logistics. After college, she worked in the private sector and held management positions at Hallmark Cards in Kansas City and Ralston Purina in St. Louis.


== Career ==


=== 1990s ===
Wagner entered Republican politics in 1990, heading the GOP's efforts during the decennial redistricting of Missouri. In 1992, she was state director of President George H. W. Bush's unsuccessful reelection campaign.


=== 2000s ===


==== Missouri GOP ====
Wagner was elected to her first term of office as chair of the Missouri Republican Party in 1999, becoming the first woman to occupy the position. Her most notable achievement in that role came during her second two-year term, when she oversaw the party's taking majority control of both chambers of the Missouri General Assembly, winning the Senate in a 2001 special election and the House in the 2002 general election, the first time this had been seen in over 40 years. During her third term, the party held its majorities in both chambers and also took the governor's seat for the first time in 12 years with Matt Blunt's election in 2004, giving the GOP complete control of state government for the first time since 1921. Her six years as chairperson witnessed George W. Bush carry Missouri in both of his presidential bids and also saw the Republican Party win a majority of the state's congressional delegation.


==== National campaigning ====
In 2001, Wagner took office as a co-chair of the Republican National Committee and helped preside over the 2004 Republican National Convention. In this position, she took a strong role in directing the development of the Winning Women initiative, whose aim was to improve the GOP's image with women and demonstrate the relevance of its platform to them. Her work with the committee took her to 48 states. In January 2005, she left her role as co-chair after one term.
In 2004, Wagner was a fundraising "ranger" for President George W. Bush.


==== U.S. ambassadorship ====
On February 20, 2005, Wagner was elected to a fourth term as chair of the Missouri Republican Party. On May 16, Bush nominated her as United States ambassador to Luxembourg. On July 16, 2005, she was confirmed in the post by a voice vote in the United States Senate, after which Senator Jim Talent said she was "a considerate woman, whose character and abilities uniquely qualify her to represent our nation."
On August 1, she was sworn in as Ambassador by U.S. secretary of state Condoleezza Rice in the Benjamin Franklin Room of the Harry S Truman Building.


=== 2010s ===


==== 2010 U.S. Senate election ====

After returning from Luxembourg, Wagner served as chair of Roy Blunt's 2010 U.S. Senate campaign. Blunt defeated Missouri Secretary of State Robin Carnahan, 54%–41%.


==== 2011 RNC chair election ====

On November 29, 2010, Wagner sent a video message to the committee members of the Republican National Committee announcing she was running for RNC chair. The election was held in January 2011, and Wagner conceded after the sixth round after receiving 17 votes. Wisconsin Republican Party chair Reince Priebus won.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 2012 ====

Wagner announced her candidacy for Missouri's 2nd congressional district after incumbent Representative Todd Akin announced his candidacy for U.S. Senate. Wagner was endorsed by New Jersey governor Chris Christie, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, former U.S. attorney general John Ashcroft, and the anti-abortion women's group the Susan B. Anthony List. She won the four-way Republican primary—the de facto election given the lack of support for Democratic nominee Glenn Koenen—with 66% of the vote. In November, she won the general election by 23 points.
Wagner is the third Republican woman elected to Congress from Missouri (after Jo Ann Emerson and Vicky Hartzler), and the second who was not elected as a stand-in for her husband (after Hartzler; Emerson was originally elected to finish out the term of her late husband, Bill Emerson).


==== 2014 ====

In her first bid for reelection, Wagner ran unopposed in the Republican primary and easily won the general election, increasing her margin of victory from 2012.


==== 2016 ====


==== 2018 ====

Wagner had a closer-than-expected race against Democratic attorney Cort VanOstran, but prevailed with 51.2% of the vote to VanOstran's 47.2%. It was only the third time since 1986 that a Democrat had managed even 40% of the vote in this district.


==== 2020 ====
Wagner was considered potentially vulnerable due to the surprisingly close margin in 2018 and President Donald Trump's unpopularity in suburban areas. State senator Jill Schupp, whose state senate district covers much of the St. Louis County portion of the congressional district, won the Democratic nomination unopposed.
By the fall of 2020, The Cook Political Report listed the race as a toss-up. Wagner defeated Schupp by just over six percentage points. At the same time, Trump carried the 2nd by only 115 votes, a marked turnabout from his 11-point win in 2016. It was the closest that a Democratic presidential nominee had come to carrying the district since it lost its share of St. Louis after the 1980 census.


==== 2022 ====
Wagner was reelected in 2022, defeating Trish Gunby.


=== Tenure ===

In 2016, Wagner made headlines by withdrawing her endorsement for the GOP nominee for president, Donald Trump. Wagner's position on Trump changed several times since her initial endorsement in September; in October she withdrew her support and called on Trump to step down, but in November walked that statement back and voiced her intention to vote for Trump.
On May 4, 2017, Wagner voted for the American Health Care Act, which would have repealed Obamacare.
Wagner was one of 126 House Republicans who signed an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election.
Wagner voted to certify both Arizona's and Pennsylvania's results in the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count.
On July 19, 2022, Wagner and 46 other Republican Representatives voted for the Respect for Marriage Act, which would codify the right to same-sex marriage in federal law.


==== Legislation sponsored ====
The following is an incomplete list of legislation Wagner has sponsored:

Retail Investor Protection Act (H.R. 2374; 113th Congress) – a bill that would delay the Department of Labor's regulations on when a financial advisor must be considered a fiduciary.
Stop Advertising Victims of Exploitation Act of 2014 (H.R. 4225; 113th Congress) – a bill that would prohibit knowingly benefiting financially from, receiving anything of value from, or distributing advertising that offers a commercial sex act in a manner that violates federal criminal code prohibitions against sex trafficking of children or of any person by force, fraud, or coercion. The bill would make it a felony to post prostitution ads online. Wagner said that Congress was "taking steps towards ending what I would call modern-day slavery." She argued that her bill had been reviewed by the Justice Department in an attempt to ensure that it did not violate the First Amendment to the United States Constitution's guarantee of the right to free speech, that the House had not passed any legislation on human trafficking in 13 years, and that "our efforts to combat sex trafficking need to be updated to match the problem as it stands today."
Retail Investor Protection Act (HR 1090; 114th Congress)—a revised version of legislation Wagner sponsored that would delay the DOL's regulations regarding fiduciary advisors that passed the House on October 27, 2015, by a vote of 245–186.

Onder attended St. Louis University High School, graduating in 1980.  Onder attended Washington University in St. Louis for his undergraduate degree, where he graduated summa cum laude with a degree in Economics. Onder subsequently graduated from Washington University School of Medicine, and is a physician specializing in allergy and asthma care. He later graduated from Saint Louis University School of Law. He and his wife Allison have six children. Onder has recently obtained his Pilot’s license. He is Roman Catholic.


== Political campaigns ==
Onder served a single term in the Missouri House of Representatives from 2007 to 2008, having been elected in 2006.
In 2008, Onder left the state legislature to run for the US House in Missouri's 9th congressional district, where incumbent Kenny Hulshof was not seeking re-election. Onder distinguished himself as one of the more fiscally conservative candidates, emphasizing his free-market voting record in the Missouri House and earning the endorsement of the Club for Growth.  Onder ultimately lost the Republican primary election to Blaine Luetkemeyer.
In 2014, Onder ran for the Missouri Senate in the 2nd district, defeating Chuck Gatschenberger and Vicki Schneider in the Republican primary. No Democrats ran for the seat, so this primary victory was tantamount to election. Onder ran for reelection in 2018 and defeated his Democratic challenger to earn a second term.
In 2022, Onder announced his campaign for Saint Charles County Executive. He withdrew from the Republican primary on June 7, 2022.
In 2024, Onder announced his candidacy for Missouri's 3rd congressional district.


== State House of Representatives career ==


=== Immigration reform ===
In 2008, Onder authored and sponsored HB 1549. The bill forbids the creation of sanctuary cities in Missouri, allows for cancellation of state contracts for contractors who hire people illegally present in the United States, and requires public agencies to verify the legal status of immigrants before providing social service benefits. Additionally the bill criminalized the transportation of immigrants for exploitative purposes. The bill passed the State House and Senate with strong support and was signed into law by Matt Blunt.


=== Abortion ===
Onder also sponsored legislation that would have strengthened Missouri's informed consent before abortion statute, including requiring abortion clinics to allow pregnant women the opportunity to view an ultrasound of the fetus. The bill also would have criminalized coercing a woman to have an abortion through abuse, violence or threats. The bill passed the State House by a vote of 112-33 but died after a filibuster in the State Senate.


== State Senate career ==


=== Leadership ===

In his first year in the Senate, Onder was elected to Senate leadership as Assistant Majority Floor Leader. In 2017 he became the Chairman of the General Laws Committee. Additionally, he serves as Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Judiciary and Civil and Criminal Jurisprudence. In 2016, Onder attended the 2016 Republican National Convention after his selection as a Trump delegate as part of the Missouri delegation.


=== Caucus membership ===
Onder was a founding member of the Missouri Senate's Conservative Caucus. The Conservative Caucus's top issues include regulatory reform, tort reform, health care reform, abortion, and gun rights.


=== Social issues ===
In 2016, Onder introduced Senate Joint Resolution 39, a proposed amendment to the Missouri Constitution that would protect wedding industry businesses that refuse to serve LGBTQIA+ couples. This bill passed the Senate over a Democratic filibuster, but failed to make it out of committee in the House.
Onder was an outspoken supporter of HB 1562, a bill that expanded the crime of sex trafficking to include the advertisement of minors for prostitution or pornography.
Onder is anti-abortion, he was the original author of legislation that requires annual, unannounced state inspections of healthcare clinics that provide reproductive healthcare; bars clinics from instructing ambulances to silence their sirens or turn their lights off; mandates that pathologists test fetal tissue; enacts whistleblower protections for employees of abortion clinics; and exempts pregnancy resource centers from a St. Louis ordinance barring discrimination over reproductive choices. Onder's bill received a few significant changes, such as changing the pathologist deadline from 24 hours to five days, and became Senate Bill 5, with a new sponsor in Senator Andrew Koenig. The bill was strengthened and passed by the Missouri House of Representatives, then passed by a vote of 22-9 in the Missouri Senate and signed by Governor Eric Greitens.
In 2019, Onder strongly pushed for the Missouri Stands for the Unborn Act, a bill that banned abortion at eight weeks of pregnancy or later. The bill also banned abortions due to race, sex or a diagnosis of Down syndrome. The Missouri Senate passed the bill 24-10, and was subsequently passed by the house. The bill was signed into law by Governor Mike Parson.


=== Ethics ===
Onder also advocated for ethics reform, sponsoring and handling legislation that called for a "cooling off period" between when Missouri legislators leave office and when they can become lobbyists. Onder said that public service "is not supposed to be our pathway job into a lucrative lobbying job." Additionally, Onder sponsored a bill that would have banned gifts from lobbyists to legislators in Missouri.


=== Labor reform ===
Onder supported legislation that would have made Missouri the 28th Right-to-Work state. The bill passed through Onder's General Laws Committee before being sent to the Senate floor. While the bill was signed into law by Eric Greitens, it was later repealed by ballot initiative.
Onder authored SB 182, a bill that banned union-only project labor agreements in Missouri. The bill was signed into law by Governor Greitens.
In 2018, Onder handled HB 1413, a landmark public union bill that created transparency and accountability to protect the rights of Missouri public sector unions. Onder passed the bill through the Senate and HB 1413 was signed into law.


=== Economic issues ===
In 2017, Onder was the Senate handler for HB 130, a bill that creates a statewide regulatory framework for transportation networking companies. The bill passed with overwhelming support by a vote of 144-7 in the House and by 30-1 in the Senate. Missouri Governor Eric Greitens signed the bill into law.
In 2019, Onder introduced bills aimed at deregulating the Missouri economy. One of Onder's bills would only require cars 10 years old or older and 150,000 miles to be inspected, as opposed to 5 year old cars as under current law. Onder claimed the inspection requirement is a waste of time and money for citizens. "It disrupts the single mom, the senior citizens, the working parents day and their week these unnecessary and costly inspections," Onder stated.
Onder worked to defeat a proposed HMO tax in 2019. On his opposition to the tax, Onder stated: "Two of my most important promises to my constituents when I ran for Senate were to fight the rising costs of health care for businesses and their employees, and to oppose tax increases. So when a new health insurance tax was proposed by my own party, I was obligated to oppose it, regardless of political cost." Due to the opposition of Onder and other senators, the HMO tax proposal was removed.
In 2020, Onder introduced SB 560, a bill that would grant state licensing reciprocity to nonresident military spouses. While testifying in favor of his bill before the Veterans and Military Affairs Committee, Onder declared: "military spouses do not lose their knowledge or skills as they cross state lines in the service to their country. This is the least we can do for these heroes and their families."


=== Second Amendment ===
In 2019, Onder introduced legislation to allow people with concealed carry permits to bring a firearm onto public transit. Onder cited safety concerns and problems of crime on public transit. Onder said that the current law prevents "the right of law-abiding citizens to defend themselves." The bill did not pass that session, so Onder refiled it for the 2020 legislative session.

Samuel Bruce Graves Jr. (born November 7, 1963) is an American aviator and politician best known for serving in the U.S. House of Representatives for Missouri's 6th congressional district, with him being the dean of Missouri's congressional delegation and having held office since 2001. The aforementioned district stretches across most of the northern third of the state, with it including territory from the Kansas border to the Illinois border. The bulk of its population lives in the northern part of the Kansas City metropolitan area.
Graves is a member of the Republican Party. He has notably served as the Chair in charge of the influential Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure in the U.S. House for multiple years, with him being able to exceed the system of American term limits normally enforced by the Republican leadership.


== Early life, education, and career ==
Graves is a lifelong resident of Tarkio, a small city in Missouri's northwestern corner, not far from the Iowa and Nebraska borders. He is the son of Janice A. (née Hord) and Samuel Bruce Graves. He graduated from the University of Missouri College of Agriculture with a degree in agronomy. He is a member of the Alpha Gamma Sigma fraternity.


== Personal life ==
Graves is a general aviation pilot. He owns a Piper PA-11 Cub Special, is restoring a Beech AT-10, and co-owns a North American T-6 Texan and a Vultee BT-13 Valiant. Gould Peterson Municipal Airport is named after his uncle, an aviator, and is on his family's farm. Graves is a Baptist.


== Missouri legislature ==
Graves was elected to the Missouri House of Representatives in 1992. After one term, he was elected to the Missouri Senate in 1994 and reelected in 1998.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Committee assignments ===
Committee on Armed Services
Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Forces
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure (Chair)
As Chair of the Committee, Rep. Graves is entitled to sit as an ex officio member in any subcommittee meeting per the committee's rules.


=== Caucus memberships ===
Congressional Cement Caucus
Congressional Coalition on Adoption


== Political positions ==


=== Financial bailouts ===
After the September 2008 economic crisis, Graves voted against the proposed bailout of United States financial system, claiming it "neither 'punished the wrongdoers nor adequately protected the innocent taxpayers, investors and retirees' caught in the Wall Street banking crisis." In January 2014, Graves introduced the TRICARE Family Improvement Act. The bill would allow dependents of military members to stay on their parents' TRICARE health plan after turning age 26. The bill would change current law, which requires those dependents to change to a separate health plan after turning 26. The American Conservative Union gave him an 85% evaluation in 2017. As of 2019, Graves has a 4% lifetime score from the League of Conservation Voters.


=== Boeing 737 MAX crashes ===
Graves blamed on May 13, 2019, at the House Aviation subcommittee hearing, the 737 MAX crashes (Lion Air Flight 610) on October 29, 2018, and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302) on poor training of the Indonesian and Ethiopian pilots. He stated also that "pilots trained in the U.S. would have been successful" in handling the emergencies on both jets. One month earlier the FAA had issued the Boeing 737 MAX groundings.


=== Israel ===
Graves voted to support Israel following the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.


== Todd Graves controversy ==
Graves is the brother of Todd Graves, former U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Missouri. In October 2008, U.S. Senator Kit Bond apologized to Todd Graves after a U.S. Justice Department report cited Bond forcing Graves out over a disagreement with Representative Graves. Following the report, U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey appointed a special prosecutor to investigate whether former U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and other officials involved in the firings of nine U.S. attorneys broke the law (dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy).


== Ethics investigation ==
In 2009, the House Ethics Committee began an inquiry into whether Graves used his position on the Small Business Committee to invite Brooks Hurst, a longtime friend and a business partner of his wife, to testify at a committee hearing on the federal regulation of biodiesel and ethanol production. Graves had failed to mention the financial link between his wife and Hurst at the hearing, which dealt with federal subsidies for renewable fuels. A review by the independent Office of Congressional Ethics found "substantial reason to believe that an appearance of conflict of interest was created." Graves said in a statement, "I look forward to a quick review of the facts and answering any questions that the committee may have. I believe that a speedy review will show that all the rules of the House concerning testimony in front of the Small Business Committee were followed." The Office of Congressional Ethics referred the case to the House Ethics committee, which ended its own investigation in October, and released a report finding no ethical violations, as it asserted there was no standard in place for appearances like Hurst's.


== Political campaigns ==
Before his congressional career, Graves served eight years in the Missouri General Assembly, winning election to the Missouri House of Representatives once, and to the Missouri Senate twice.

In 2000, Democratic U.S. Representative Pat Danner suddenly retired due to breast cancer. Graves filed within the short period of time left for filing. He faced Danner's son, Steve Danner, a former state senator, in the general election. Graves called Danner as a "tax and spend liberal" and won the race with 51% of the vote, largely by running up huge margins in the district's rural areas. He was arguably helped by George W. Bush carrying the district in the 2000 presidential election, a theory known as the coattail effect.

=== 2006 ===


=== 2008 ===

In 2008, Graves' Democratic challenger was former Kansas City Mayor Kay Barnes. She was the first reasonably well-financed Democrat to run in the district since Graves' initial run. Graves gained national attention early in the race for running an ad accusing Barnes of promoting "San Francisco values." Despite Barnes' roots in the district  (she grew up in St. Joseph and lived in the district's share of Kansas City), Graves was reelected handily, with 59% of the vote to Barnes's 37%.

Jason Thomas Smith (born June 16, 1980) is an American businessman and politician who has been the U.S. representative for Missouri's 8th congressional district since 2013. The district comprises 30 counties, covering just under 20,000 square miles of southeastern and southern Missouri.
Before being elected to Congress, Smith served four full terms and one partial term in the Missouri House of Representatives. He was the majority whip during the 96th Missouri General Assembly and as the speaker pro tempore during the 97th Missouri General Assembly.

At age 20, Smith earned two degrees from the University of Missouri: a Bachelor of Science in agriculture economics and a Bachelor of Science in business administration. He attended law school at Oklahoma City University. He is a licensed real estate agent and formed his own small business specializing in property investment and development. He earned his Juris Doctor in 2004.
After passing the Missouri Bar in 2004, Smith practiced law at a local law firm in Cuba, Missouri. He also took over his family's farm, just outside Salem, which has been in Smith's family for four generations. At this time, he was a co-owner of a dog breeding business which his mother operated.


== Missouri House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 2005 special election ====
After State Representative Frank Barnitz resigned in 2005, Smith ran for Missouri's 150th House District in a special election. The 150th covered portions of Dent, Phelps, Crawford, and Reynolds counties. Smith defeated Democratic challenger Bobby Simpson 54%–44%.

One year after being elected to the Missouri House of Representatives in a special election, Smith defeated Democrat Jim O'Donnell 64%–32%.


==== 2008 election ====

Governor Jay Nixon, a Democrat, signed the repeal into law in 2011.
In 2013, Smith was elected by his peers to serve as the speaker pro tempore.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===
2013 special election

Smith ran for the vacant 8th congressional district of Missouri seat after U.S. Representative Jo Ann Emerson resigned to accept a CEO position with the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association.
Per Missouri statute, Smith was selected by the 8th District Republican Central Committee to be the party's nominee in the June special election. The selection process—which began with 27 candidates and narrowed to 13 on nomination day—lasted six total rounds before Smith was the last one standing as the Republican nominee on February 9, 2013. Some of the other candidates included State Representative Todd Richardson of Poplar Bluff, former State Treasurer of Missouri and U.S. Representative Wendell Bailey, former State Senator Jason Crowell of Cape Girardeau, Lieutenant Governor Peter Kinder, former State Treasurer of Missouri Sarah Steelman, State Representative Clint Tracy of Cape Girardeau, and State Senator Wayne Wallingford of Cape Girardeau.
In the June special election, Smith was challenged by Democratic State Representative Steve Hodges of East Prairie, businessman Doug Enyart of the Constitution Party, and Libertarian Bill Slantz. He was declared the winner of the special election on June 4. The election marked the 47th consecutive U.S. House race in Missouri in which Democrats failed to pick up a Republican-held seat dating back to 1994 – the second longest Democratic pick-up drought in the nation.

2014
After an unopposed primary election on August 5, 2014 and 17 months after the special election, Smith was up for his first reelection on November 4, 2014. He won a five-way race with two-thirds of the vote and carried all 30 counties in the district.


=== Tenure ===

In 2015, Smith condemned the Supreme Court's ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, which held that same-sex marriage bans violated the constitution.
On March 8, 2017, Smith, during debate about a tanning salon tax under the Affordable Care Act, wondered aloud, "What I found on Google is roughly 80% of who's taxed is women... Today is International Women's Day. It's interesting no one is bringing that up." He continued, "You look at the number one cause of skin cancer... It's the sun. So I've noticed the people over here haven't found too many taxes they dislike. So why have they not proposed a tax on the sun?"
Smith is a defender of gun rights; on December 6, 2017, he voted for the  Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017, a bill that would allow individuals to cross state line while carrying a gun.
As a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, Smith had a role in writing and passing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
On January 19, 2018, Smith was one of the 235 Republicans that voted for HR 4712, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, a bill that established procedural requirements for when an abortion results in a child born prematurely.
On January 17, 2019, Smith shouted "Go back to Puerto Rico!" at House Democratic members on the House floor while Representative Tony Cardenas was presiding. He later clarified and apologized to Cardenas and stated his remark was in reference to a recent trip taken to Puerto Rico by several lawmakers, including Cardenas, not to single out anyone's ethnicity. His apology was accepted.
In December 2020, Smith was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting certain voting procedures during the 2020 presidential election. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a statement that called signing the amicus brief an act of "election subversion". She also reprimanded the House members, including Smith, who supported the lawsuit: "The 126 Republican Members that signed onto this lawsuit brought dishonor to the House. Instead of upholding their oath to support and defend the Constitution, they chose to subvert the Constitution and undermine public trust in our sacred democratic institutions."
Smith was present on the floor of the House chamber during the 2021 storming of the United States Capitol.
On May 13, 2021, Smith voted against HR 2547 - Comprehensive Debt Collection Improvement Act, a bill that provides additional financial protections for consumers and places restrictions on debt collection activities.
Smith opposes COVID-19 vaccine mandates, tweeting in July 2021, "The Biden administration wants to knock down your door KGB-style to force people to get vaccinated. We must oppose forced vaccination!"
On February 9, 2022, Smith announced he would seek reelection for a sixth term and pursue the chairmanship of the House Ways and Means Committee, forgoing a run for the United States Senate in the 2022 midterm elections.
In 2024, Smith voted against the $60 billion military aid package for Ukraine, although much of the money would go to his constituency.

A member of the Republican Party, he previously served two stints as a member of the Nebraska Legislature from the 19th district, from 2005 to 2013 and 2021 to 2022. He served as speaker of the legislature from 2007 to 2013.


== Early life and education ==
Born in Omaha, Flood was raised in Norfolk, Nebraska. In 1993, he graduated from Norfolk Catholic High School in Norfolk, Nebraska. He received a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Notre Dame in 1997 and a Juris Doctor from the University of Nebraska College of Law in 2001.


== Career ==
Flood worked at a Norfolk radio station in high school. At the University of Notre Dame, he operated and hosted a show on the campus's radio station. After graduation, he worked as "Sideshow Mike" on WBYT's morning show for a year. Upon his return to Nebraska, he worked as a radio personality at Lincoln-based country station KFGE. In 1999, during his second year of law school, he launched KUSO as the first station in what would become Flood Communications.
As of 2023, he owned 15 radio stations and seven television stations in Nebraska. In 2015, Flood founded the News Channel Nebraska network, in which all television and radio stations participate. NCN is Nebraska's only 24-hour news channel. Flood no longer solely owns the stations, having sold parts of the company to in-state investors. In addition to being the operator of News Channel Nebraska, he was on-air talent, acting as a news reporter and hosting the variety show Quarantine Tonight during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2004, Flood ran for a seat in the Nebraska Legislature, representing the 19th legislative district, which was coterminous with Madison County and included Norfolk. The incumbent, Gene Tyson, was retiring; Flood ran unopposed for the seat. In 2010, he was named to Time's "40 Under 40" list as one of the rising stars in American politics. During his first stint in the Nebraska Legislature, Flood introduced and successfully passed the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, the nation's first 20-week abortion ban. During a special legislative session in 2011, he successfully brokered a compromise that rerouted the Keystone XL pipeline.

==== 2022 special election ====

On January 16, 2022, Flood announced his candidacy in the 2022 United States House of Representatives elections in Nebraska, challenging the incumbent Republican Jeff Fortenberry to represent Nebraska's 1st congressional district. Fortenberry resigned from office on March 31, 2022, following a felony conviction. His resignation necessitated a special election, for which the Nebraska Republican Party nominated Flood.

Donald John Bacon (born August 16, 1963) is an American politician and retired military officer serving as the U.S. representative for Nebraska's 2nd congressional district since 2017. Before holding public office, he was a United States Air Force officer, retiring as brigadier general with time as wing commander at Ramstein Air Base, Germany and Offutt Air Force Base south of Omaha, Nebraska, prior to his retirement from the military in 2014. His district includes all of Omaha and the areas surrounding the Offutt base.
Bacon is a moderate centrist within the Republican Party. As of 2023, he ranks eighth in bipartisanship among members of Congress according to the Lugar Center. His district was carried by Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election and Kamala Harris in 2024 presidential election, making it a politically competitive area.
A member of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, which represents the most moderate of the five GOP factions in the House, Bacon was an original sponsor of the Naming Commission, which stripped the Department of Defense of names valorizing the Confederacy, and of the Emmett Till Antilynching Act, which established lynching as a unique hate crime, and voted to enact the Respect for Marriage Act, which codified federal recognition of same-sex marriage. He was one of 37 Republicans who rejected attempts to overturn the 2020 election, and one of 35 who supported the committee to investigate the January 6th attack. He has repeatedly sparred with members of the right-wing House Freedom Caucus.
An active voice on foreign policy, Bacon is one of a slate of U.S. representatives sanctioned by the Russian government, and was the first member of Congress to be hacked by the Chinese government.


== Early life, education, and military career ==
Bacon was born in Chicago Heights, Illinois, on August 16, 1963, the son of Donald and Joan Bacon of Bourbonnais. He grew up on a family farm in Momence, Illinois, and graduated from Grace Baptist Academy in Kankakee in 1980.

Bacon attended Northern Illinois University and interned in Representative Ed Madigan's Washington D.C. office during his senior year in 1984. He entered the Air Force in 1985, commissioning through the Air Force Officer Training School at Lackland AFB, Texas. In his military career he specialized in electronic warfare, intelligence, reconnaissance and public affairs, and also qualified as a Master Navigator. He served as a Wing Commander at Ramstein Air Base in Germany and at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska, as a Group commander and Squadron commander at Davis–Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona and an Expeditionary Squadron commander in Iraq. Bacon has earned master's degrees from the National War College and the University of Phoenix. His final assignment was as Director of ISR Strategy, Plans, Doctrine and Force Development, AF/A2, Headquarters U.S. Air Force at the Pentagon from July 2012. In 2014, Bacon retired from the U.S.  Force. During his 29 years in the Air Force, he was awarded the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal, two Legion of Merits and two Bronze Star Medals; he was selected as Europe's top Air Force Wing Commander in 2009. He served as an aide to U.S. representative Jeff Fortenberry and assistant professor at Bellevue University before running for office.


== Political career ==


=== Elections ===
2016

In the 2016 elections, Bacon won the Republican primary for the U.S. House of Representatives in Nebraska's 2nd congressional district, a primarily urban and suburban district in metro Omaha, covering parts of Douglas and Sarpy counties.
The general election race was considered a tossup, with Democratic incumbent Brad Ashford seen as having a slight edge. After a 2005 videotape showing Donald Trump making lewd remarks to Billy Bush surfaced in October 2016, Bacon said that Trump could not win the presidency and should withdraw from the race in favor of "a strong conservative candidate, like Mike Pence." But Bacon did not say that he would not vote for Donald Trump, since he did not "believe Hillary is the right person. I'm in a quandary."
Bacon narrowly defeated Ashford in the general election on November 8, 2016, with 48.9% of the vote to Ashford's 47.7%. He was the only Republican to defeat an incumbent Democrat in the 2016 House elections.

2018

Bacon was reelected in 2018, narrowly defeating progressive Democrat Kara Eastman with 51.0% of the vote to her 49.0%.

2020

Bacon and Eastman faced off again in the 2020 general election. Bacon was reelected by a larger margin than in 2018, winning 51.0% of the vote to Eastman's 46.2%, even as Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden won the district by 6.5 points. He was endorsed by his predecessor, Democrat Brad Ashford, whom he defeated in 2016.


==== 2022 ====

Bacon narrowly won re-election in 2022 against Nebraska state senator Tony Vargas.


==== 2024 ====

Bacon claimed yet another narrow win in the November 2024 general election in a rematch against Democratic challenger Tony Vargas. Bacon prevailed without the support of the top of the Republican ticket, former President Trump, who had sought a primary challenger against Bacon, as well as the state's Republican Party, which backed conservative populist Dan Frei for the nomination, losing by 24 points.


=== Tenure ===
After his election, Bacon was sworn in to the 115th Congress in January 2017. During Donald Trump's presidency, Bacon voted in line with Trump's position 89.4% of the time.
Bacon was reelected in 2018 and in 2021. During the first year of Joe Biden's presidency, Bacon voted in line with Biden's position 29.5% of the time.
In 2022, Bacon intervened to help Trump Media obtain an O-1 visa to hire an executive from North Macedonia named Vladimir Novachki.
Following the 2022 midterm elections and announcements by Freedom Caucus members that they would oppose or demand concessions of presumptive House speaker Kevin McCarthy, Bacon announced he was willing to work with Democrats to elect a moderate Republican.
In August 2023, the FBI revealed that Bacon was the first US lawmaker to be targeted in a cyberespionage intrusion by Chinese government hackers. When asked about the intrusion, which Bacon said largely compromised campaign and personal email data, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, DC called the incident a "smear" and part of a "groundless narrative." The embassy denial included a complaint that the U.S. government had undercut China's sovereignty with recent arms sales to Taiwan, an effort which Bacon had vocally supported. A spokeswoman for Bacon's office said it was likely a reason for the attack.
Following failed House votes on bills to avoid a government shutdown beginning on October 1, 2023, Bacon said of Republicans in the Freedom Caucus who sought major concessions or pushed for a shutdown "some of these folks would vote against the Bible because there's not enough Jesus in it."
Bacon voted against the October 2023 removal of Kevin McCarthy as speaker of the House, calling it a vote "for chaos", and "a good day for Russia and China." He supported Steve Scalise in his initial bid for the October 2023 House Speaker election, but voted against the subsequent unsuccessful bid by Freedom Caucus founder Jim Jordan, former president Donald Trump's preferred candidate. Following the first round of voting on Jordan's nomination, Bacon revealed that his wife and staff were being harassed and threatened by phone and in public to push him to support Jordan, saying "there's been a bullying campaign...they're being told on certain cable channels that the world's falling apart...and they feel like approved to cross these boundaries and to be wrong." He ultimately supported Mike Johnson's successful bid for the role.
Bacon supported the November 2023 expulsion of George Santos.
Bacon will be seated in the 119th United States Congress in January 2025.


=== Committee assignments ===
Committee on Agriculture
Subcommittee on Livestock and Foreign Agriculture
Subcommittee on Nutrition, Oversight, and Department Operations
Committee on Armed Services
Subcommittee on Intelligence and Special Operations
Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Forces


=== Caucus memberships ===


== Political positions ==
Bacon is frequently described as a moderate centrist within the Republican Party.


=== Armed services and foreign policy ===

Bacon has been a member of the Armed Services Committee since taking office in 2017.
Bacon supported airstrikes in Syria in retaliation for the Assad government's use of chemical weapons. In 2019, Bacon voted for a resolution opposing Trump's move to withdraw U.S. support for the Kurds in Syria, which exposed Kurdish militias to attacks from Turkey.
At a Brookings Institution event in October 2017, Bacon stressed the importance of military readiness and called for U.S. Air Force crews to increase flight hours to enhance readiness. He also said the "gravest threat" to military readiness was the "partisan divide" in government, which had prevented necessary increases in spending.
Bacon supports a stronger U.S. presence in the Balkans to counter Russia, which he has called a key adversary of the United States. He has expressed alarm regarding Russia's activity in Ukraine and the Balkans, as well as Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections and attempted Russian interference in other nations' elections.

In November 2017, Bacon told an electronic warfare (EW) conference that the U.S. military needed "to elevate the electromagnetic spectrum to an official domain of warfare—alongside land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace–and appoint general officers as EW advocates in all four services and to the joint staff." He said the U.S. should re-intensify its EW capabilities, which he said had atrophied after the collapse of the Soviet Union.Bacon is a consistent supporter of Taiwan. In 2019, he spent time with Representative Salud Carbajal and former speaker Paul Ryan in Taiwan to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Taiwan Relations Act and open a new de facto Embassy. Bacon said, "we owe it to be clear that Taiwan is a success story and we have to support their democracy."
At the outset of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Bacon said:"Today starts a new and dark chapter in national security that is Hobbesian in nature where bullies will dominate weaker countries. Where might makes right, and dictators prey on their neighbors unless free nations band together and deter this threat.…We have entered a new cold war"In April 2022, the Russian Federation sanctioned and banned Bacon in retaliation for U.S. participation in sanctions against pro-war members of the Russian Duma.
In February 2023, Bacon signed a letter advocating for President Biden to give F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine.


=== Agriculture ===

Bacon has been a member of the House Agriculture Committee since 2017. In 2019, he urged the United States Army Corps of Engineers to streamline its response to the 2019 Midwestern U.S. floods and pushed to fund levies to shore up flooded farmland and Offutt Air Force Base.
Bacon supported the 2018 Republican-led omnibus Farm Bill which legalized the commercialization of Hemp products.


=== Abortion ===
Bacon is firmly against abortion. He is a co-sponsor of the Life at Conception Act, which would guarantee "equal protection for the right to life of each born and preborn human person" under the 14th Amendment.
In 2017, he voted for legislation to ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy and to repeal a rule requiring state and local governments to distribute federal funds to Federally Qualified Health Centers even if they perform abortions, a measure aimed at defunding Planned Parenthood. Bacon said he supported redirecting funds to community health care centers that do not provide abortion services.
Bacon supports a federal ban on abortion. He supported a constitutional amendment to ban abortion nationwide several times since 2017. In 2024, Bacon still signaled support for a national ban on abortion but with exceptions for the life of the mother. Bacon opposes the 2024 Nebraska Right to Abortion Initiative that would amend the state's constitution to establish a right to abortion until fetal viability but supports the opposing ballot measure (Protect Women and Children) which would criminalize most abortions after the first trimester and may allow lawmakers to restrict or ban abortion in the future.


=== Civil rights ===
In 2019, Bacon and Representative Seth Moulton introduced The Justice for Victims of Lynching Act of 2019. The bill specified lynching as a unique deprivation of civil rights, and would for the first time make it a federal crime. The bill's language was incorporated into the 2020 Emmett Till Antilynching Act, which passed the House but was blocked by Rand Paul in the Senate. A later version became law in 2022.
Bacon expressed support for "most of" the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2020. He supported mandatory wearing of body cameras by police officers while on duty and a national registry for police misconduct, but opposed ending qualified immunity provisions for officers. He also criticized provisions ending the Department of Defense 1033 program, which allows the transfer of surplus military equipment to law enforcement agencies, saying, "if our police are encountering a serious threat, I don't want an equal fight for them." He ultimately voted against the legislation in a mostly party-line vote.


==== The Naming Commission ====

After the murder of George Floyd, Bacon and Anthony Brown introduced legislation to rename Department of Defense assets that valorized Southern confederate leaders or values. Alongside companion legislation introduced in the Senate by Elizabeth Warren, the bill resulted in the creation of The Naming Commission through incorporation into the omnibus National Defense Authorization Act. When asked about the bill, President Trump insisted that he would "not even consider" the proposal, to which Bacon replied in The New York Times, "you're wrong—you need to change... we're not the party of Jim Crow." Trump vetoed the NDAA for reasons he said included funding for the commission, after which Congress delivered the only veto override of his presidency.


=== LGBT rights ===
On July 19, 2022, Bacon and 46 other Republican representatives voted for the Respect for Marriage Act, codified the right to same-sex marriage in federal law. He said he does not believe "the government should dictate who can marry each other based on gender, race, or ethnicity."


=== Drug policy ===
In 2018, Bacon said that he opposed marijuana legalization as a personal matter, but that he supported decriminalization at the federal level and believed that states should be permitted to make the decision. Bacon supported the 2018 Farm Bill, which legalized industrial hemp production.


=== Economic issues ===

In 2017, Bacon voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Bacon has expressed support for raising the full retirement age for eligibility for Social Security for Americans now under age 40.


=== Environment ===
Bacon has said, "I don't think we know for certain how much of climate change is being caused by normal cyclical changes in weather vs. human causes. I support legislation that allows for continued incremental improvement in our environment, but oppose extreme measures that create significant economic and job disruption."


=== Gun policy ===
In 2018, Bacon said he would support a ban on bump stocks. In 2021, he introduced legislation to enhance penalties for engaging in illicit straw purchases of firearms.


=== Health care ===
Bacon favors repealing the Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly known as Obamacare, and opposes proposals for Medicare for All or single-payer healthcare. In May 2017, he voted for the American Health Care Act of 2017, Republican health-care legislation that would have repealed large portions of the ACA.


=== Immigration ===

In August 2017, Bacon and five of his House colleagues urged Trump to preserve the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program for undocumented youth brought to the United States as children (also known as "Dreamers"), "until we can pass a permanent legislative solution." In 2019, he voted for legislation to create a pathway to citizenship for undocumented youth.
Bacon has expressed support for construction of the U.S.-Mexico border wall supported by Trump. Bacon voted against legislation to end the December 2018–January 2019 government shutdown by appropriating funds without money for a border wall. He said that Trump's attempt to circumvent Congress by declaring a national emergency to redirect money from military construction to building a border wall was not "the right way to go" because it infringed on congressional powers, but voted against a House resolution to overturn the emergency declaration and against overriding Trump's veto of legislation that would have overturned the declaration.
In 2017, Bacon reintroduced the Kerrie Orozco Act, which would "allow the spouses of first responders, killed in the line of duty, access to a quicker process of becoming an American citizen."


=== Impeachment ===
In 2019, the House voted on two articles of impeachment against Donald Trump. Bacon voted against both articles.
In 2021, the House voted on one article of impeachment against Trump for incitement of insurrection after the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Bacon voted against the article.
In 2023 Bacon voted for the impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden, but said he was skeptical of the efforts to impeach, stating that he thinks Biden did engage in corruption, but that impeachments are bad for the nation and generally hurt the election successes of the party bringing the proceedings.


=== Infrastructure ===
Bacon initially said he would support President Biden's Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and criticized Republicans for opposing it, but during negotiations he said he could not commit to voting for the bill. Ultimately, Bacon was one of 13 House Republicans to break with their party and vote with a majority of Democrats in favor of the legislation.


=== Israel ===
Bacon supports an "ironclad partnership" with Israel and endorsed the recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Bacon voted to provide Israel with support following the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.


=== 2020 and 2024 presidential elections ===
In a December 2020 Washington Post survey of the 249 Republican members of Congress, Bacon was one of 37 who acknowledged Joe Biden as the legitimate President-elect.
Bacon did not join congressional Republicans who sided with the Trump campaign's attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election. He voted to certify both Arizona's and Pennsylvania's votes in the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count.
On May 19, 2021, Bacon was one of 35 Republicans who joined Democrats in voting to approve legislation to establish the January 6 commission meant to investigate the January 6 United States Capitol attack. Before the vote, he was one of only a few Republican lawmakers who openly expressed their support for the commission.
On September 13, 2024, Bacon and Representative Josh Gottheimer released a bipartisan letter spearheaded by centrist House Representatives in which they pledged to respect the results of the 2024 presidential election. Five other Republicans signed the letter alongside Bacon.
On September 18, 2024, the entire Nebraska delegation, including Bacon, signed a letter to Governor Pillen supporting changing Nebraska's presidential election system to a winner-takes-all method, effectively eliminating the allocation of electoral votes by congressional district.


=== Veterans ===
The PACT ACT which expanded VA benefits to veterans exposed to toxic chemicals during their military service, received a "nay" from Bacon. Regarding cannabis, despite lobbying from VSOs such as the DAV, Bacon also voted against the 2022 MORE Act.

Adrian Michael Smith (born December 19, 1970) is an American politician serving as the U.S. representative for Nebraska's 3rd congressional district since 2007. A member of the Republican Party, he represented the 48th district in the Nebraska Legislature from 1999 to 2007. Smith is the dean of Nebraska's congressional delegation.


== Early life and education ==
Smith was born in Scottsbluff, Nebraska, and at a young age moved with his family to a rural neighborhood south of Gering, Nebraska. After graduating from Gering High School in 1989, he attended Liberty University. He transferred to the University of Nebraska–Lincoln midway through his second year of college, graduating in 1993. While a student at Nebraska, he interned in the Nebraska Governor's Office and, later, served as a legislative page in the Nebraska Legislature.


== Early career ==
Smith returned to Gering after college, and in 1994 began serving as a member of the Gering City Council. He has also worked in the private sector as a realtor and marketing specialist for the housing industry.


=== Nebraska Legislature ===


==== Elections ====
In 1998, Smith defeated incumbent State Legislator Joyce Hillman 55%–45%. In 2002, he was reelected to a second term unopposed. Since Nebraska voters passed Initiative Measure 415 in 2001, he was term-limited.


==== Committee assignments ====
Smith sat on the Natural Resources and Building Maintenance committees and was vice chair of the Transportation and Telecommunications committee. He served as vice chair of the Military and Veterans’ Affairs Committee and chaired the Four State Legislative Conference in 2001.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 2006 ====
Smith ran for the open seat in the 3rd district in the 2006 election. Three-term incumbent Tom Osborne gave up the seat to run for governor of Nebraska.

Smith won the Republican primary with 39% of the vote in a field of five candidates. He faced Democrat Scott Kleeb, a ranch hand and Yale graduate, in the general election.
About a third of the funding for Smith's campaign came from members of the Club for Growth, a fiscally conservative group that supports tax cuts, limited government, school choice, and eliminating agricultural subsidies and the US Department of Agriculture.
For a time, Smith was presumed to be a prohibitive favorite in this overwhelmingly Republican district. The 3rd is one of the most Republican districts in the nation; presidential and statewide candidates routinely win it with 70% or more of the vote. The 3rd is extremely difficult to campaign in and has few unifying influences. It covers nearly 65,000 square miles (170,000 km2), two time zones, and 68.5 of Nebraska's 93 counties (one of which, Cherry County, is larger in area than the entire state of Connecticut). Despite that, Kleeb raised more money than any other Democrat had raised in the district in decades. Overall, the race was the most expensive in the district since it assumed its current configuration in 1963.
As the race become more competitive than initially expected, it received late national attention from the House campaign committees.
President George W. Bush made an appearance in the district two days before the election to campaign for Smith—a sign that the Republican party was concerned about its chances in what had long been presumed to be a very safe seat.
In the end, Smith won by 10 percentage points, taking 55% of the vote to Kleeb's 45%. This was the closest a Democrat had come to winning the district in 16 years; in 1990, Republican Bill Barrett defeated fellow Unicameral member Sandra Scofield by only 4,400 votes. It was also only the third time a Democrat had come reasonably close to winning this district in its current configuration; besides Barrett's narrow win in 1990, Virginia D. Smith won her first term by 737 votes in 1974.
Besides Bush's visit two days before the election, Smith likely rode the coattails of Governor Dave Heineman, who won many of the counties in the district with 80% or more of the vote in his bid for a full term.


==== 2008 ====
Smith won the primary with 87% of the vote. He was reelected to a second term, defeating Democratic nominee Jay Stoddard 77%–23%.


==== 2010 ====
Smith won the primary with 88% of the vote. He was reelected to a third term, defeating Democratic nominee Rebekah Davis 70%–18%.


==== 2012 ====
Smith won the Republican primary with 82% of the vote. He was reelected to a fourth term, defeating Democratic nominee Mark Sullivan 74%–26%.


==== 2014 ====
Smith won the Republican primary with 68% of the vote. He was reelected to a fifth term, defeating Democratic nominee Mark Sullivan a second time, 75%–25%.


==== 2016 ====
Smith was unopposed in the Republican primary and the general election.


==== 2018 ====
Smith was renominated with 66% of the vote. He was reelected to a seventh term, defeating Democratic nominee Paul Theobald 77%–23%.


==== 2020 ====
Smith won the Republican primary over four other candidates with 83% of the vote, and won the general election with 79% of the vote over Democratic nominee Mark Elworth Jr., a marijuana legalization activist.


==== 2022 ====
Smith won the Republican primary with 76% of the vote and was reelected over Democratic nominee David Else with 78% of the vote in the general election.


==== 2024 ====
Smith won the Republican primary with 74% of the vote and was reelected over Democratic nominee Daniel Ebers with 80% of the vote in the general election.


=== Tenure ===
In December 2020, Smith was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated incumbent Donald Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a statement that called signing the amicus brief an act of "election subversion." She also reprimanded Smith and the other House members who supported the lawsuit: "The 126 Republican Members that signed onto this lawsuit brought dishonor to the House. Instead of upholding their oath to support and defend the Constitution, they chose to subvert the Constitution and undermine public trust in our sacred democratic institutions." New Jersey Representative Bill Pascrell, citing section three of the 14th Amendment, called for Pelosi to not seat Smith and the other Republicans who signed the brief supporting the suit, arguing that "the text of the 14th Amendment expressly forbids Members of Congress from engaging in rebellion against the United States. Trying to overturn a democratic election and install a dictator seems like a pretty clear example of that."

Mark Eugene Amodei ( AM-ə-day; born June 12, 1958) is an American lawyer and politician serving as the U.S. representative for Nevada's 2nd congressional district since 2011. The only Republican in Nevada's congressional delegation since 2019, Amodei served in the Nevada Assembly from 1997 to 1999 and in the Nevada Senate, representing the Capital District, from 1999 to 2011.
Amodei is generally considered a moderate Republican, being a member of the Republican Governance Group, the first House Republican to support the impeachment inquiry during the first impeachment of Donald Trump (but voting against impeachment), and supporting programs such as DACA throughout his tenure.
Amodei chaired the Nevada Republican Party from 2010 until 2011, when he stepped down to run in the September 13, 2011, special election to succeed Dean Heller (who had been appointed to the U.S. Senate) as the U.S. representative for the state's 2nd congressional district. In 2019, Amodei became the dean of Nevada's congressional delegation and its sole Republican member after Heller lost his bid for reelection to the Senate.


== Early life, education and military service ==
Amodei was born in Carson City, Nevada, the son of Joy LaRhe (née Longero) and Donald Mark Amodei. His father was of half Italian and half Irish descent, and one of his maternal great-grandfathers was Italian. Amodei graduated from Carson High School in 1976, where he was student class president. He graduated from the University of Nevada in 1980 with a B.A. in political science, and received his J.D. degree from the University of the Pacific McGeorge School of Law in 1983.
When Amodei entered the U.S. Army, he had not yet passed the bar exam, so he was assigned to an artillery unit. He attended The JAG School at the University of Virginia and entered U.S. Army JAG Corps after passing the bar. He became an Army JAG Corps officer prosecuting criminal matters, an Assistant U.S. Attorney and Assistant Post Judge Advocate. He was awarded the Army Achievement Medal, the Army Commendation Medal and the Meritorious Service Medal. He served with the United States Army Judge Advocate General Corps from 1983 to 1987. He returned home to become an attorney with the law firms Allison MacKenzie in Carson City and Kummer Kaempfer Bonner Renshaw and Ferrario (now Kaempfer Crowell) in Reno. He served as a lawyer with Allison, MacKenzie from 1987 to 2004 and with Kummer from 2004 to 2007.
As a lawyer, Amodei has been a sole practitioner since 2009. He served as president of the Nevada Mining Association from 2007 to 2008.


== Nevada legislature ==


=== Elections ===
In 1996, Amodei was elected to the Nevada Assembly, representing Carson City. In 1998, he ran for the Nevada Senate in the Capital District. He defeated incumbent Democratic State Senator Ernie Adler, 52%–48%. In 2002, he was reelected to a second term with 84% of the vote. In 2006, he was reelected to a third term with 78% of the vote.


=== Tenure ===
Amodei was named the Outstanding Freshman Legislator in 1997. He was selected to serve as president pro tempore of the Nevada Senate from 2003 to 2008.

2003 tax increase
In 2003 Amodei and Terry Care co-authored a plan to increase taxes in Nevada by $1 billion. The plan was offered as an alternative to Governor Kenny Guinn's plan, which called for over $1 billion in revenue increases. The final plan raised taxes by $873 million.

Collective bargaining
In 2009, Amodei supported a proposal to expand collective bargaining rights for state workers, who he believed were unfairly treated during the budget process.

Gas tax
In 2009, Amodei sponsored a bill that would have allowed for a gas tax increase in Washoe County; the plan gained public approval in an advisory vote.

Medical liability reform
In 2003, Amodei voted against a tort reform bill that would have changed Nevada's medical liability law. He was the only Republican senator to vote against the bill.


=== Committee assignments ===
Amodei has served on the Legislative Commission, the Education Commission of the States, the Public Lands Committee, the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency Legislative Oversight Committee, as vice chair of the Governor's Task Force on Access to Public Health Care, as chair of the Education Technology Committee, and as a member of the Nevada Supreme Court's committee on court funding.


== 2010 U.S. Senate election ==

Amodei ran for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate against Democrat Harry Reid, the Majority Leader. He dropped out before election day, as State Assemblywoman Sharron Angle won the primary and lost the general election to Reid.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 2011 ====

On September 13, 2011, Nevada's 2nd congressional district elected Amodei to replace U.S. Representative Dean Heller. Heller had been appointed to fill John Ensign's seat in the U.S. Senate after Ensign resigned from the position. Amodei announced his bid for the congressional seat in May 2011. The next month, he won the Republican nomination by taking 221 out of 323 ballots. In the primary, he defeated State Senator Greg Brower, who received 56 votes, and U.S. Navy veteran Kirk Lippold, who received 46 votes.
Amodei defeated Democratic nominee Kate Marshall 58%–36%. He won every county in the district.


==== 2012 ====

Amodei ran for a full term against Democrat Samuel Koepnick, an information technology employee for the State of Nevada. He was endorsed by the NRA Political Victory Fund (NRA-PVF). He did so in a district that had been made slightly more compact than its predecessor in redistricting. It lost almost all of its southern portion to the new 4th district. Even so, it was still the eighth-largest district in the country that did not cover an entire state. Amodei defeated Koepnick 58%–36%.


==== 2014 ====

Amodei ran for reelection to his second full term. He defeated Democrat Kristen Spees, 65.8% to 27.9%.


==== 2016 ====

Amodei ran for reelection to a third full term. He defeated Democrat Chip Evans, 58.3% to 36.9%.


==== 2018 ====

Amodei ran for reelection to a fourth full term. He defeated Democrat Clint Koble, 58.2% to 41.8%.


==== 2020 ====

Amodei ran for reelection to a fifth full term. He defeated Democrat Patricia Ackerman, 56.5% to 40.7%.


==== 2022 ====

Amodei ran for reelection to a sixth full term. He won the Republican primary with 54.9% of the vote and went on to defeat Democrat Elizabeth Krause, 59.7% to 37.8%.
The Congressional Leadership Fund, the super PAC endorsed by Kevin McCarthy, spent over $200,000 supporting Mark Amodei in the primary.


=== Tenure ===
Amodei was sworn in on September 15, 2011.
Amodei voted against the bill to end the United States federal government shutdown of 2013. Of the vote, he said, "During two campaigns, I told Nevadans I would give my full attention to such issues as reining in runaway federal spending, debt, and the harmful aspects of the Affordable Care Act. Unlike many in this town, I will not test your memories and hope you have forgotten. I will continue to pursue these necessary goals. Nothing in this legislation changes the real threats to our country's economy."
Amodei received a 0% rating from Planned Parenthood's 2014 Congressional Scorecard for supporting a nationwide abortion ban after 20 weeks and banning abortion access in the District of Columbia and through the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
Amodei announced his support for a House impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump on September 27, 2019. National news media began to refer to Amodei as the first House Republican to support impeachment. A spokesman then further clarified his position by stating Amodei supported an inquiry but not impeachment.


==== Immigration ====
Amodei voted for the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020, which authorized DHS to nearly double the available H-2B visas for the remainder of FY 2020.
Amodei voted for the Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1158), which effectively prohibits ICE from cooperating with Health and Human Services to detain or remove illegal alien sponsors of unaccompanied alien children (UACs).
Amodei supports Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).
In 2021, Amodei was one of 30 Republicans to vote to give legal status to illegal immigrant agricultural workers.


==== Israel ====
Amodei voted to provide Israel with financial support following 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.


==== LGBT rights ====
In 2021, Amodei was among the House Republicans to sponsor the Fairness for All Act, the Republican alternative to the Equality Act. The bill's stated goal is to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity, and simultaneously protect the free exercise of religion.


=== Legislation ===
On July 25, 2014, Amodei introduced the Northern Nevada Land Conservation and Economic Development Act (H.R. 5205; 113th Congress), a bill that would require the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to convey certain federal lands in Nevada to other government entities. The bill is a package of numerous other bills related to land conveyance in Nevada, which make up the bulk of Amodei's legislation.


=== Veterans ===
The PACT ACT which expanded VA benefits to veterans exposed to toxic chemicals during their military service, received a "nay" from Amodei. Regarding cannabis, despite lobbying from VSOs such as the DAV, Amodei also voted against the 2022 MORE Act.

Christopher Henry Smith (born March 4, 1953) is an American politician serving his 22nd term as the U.S. representative for New Jersey's 4th congressional district. Though it has taken various forms, his district has always been situated in central New Jersey. Currently, the district contains parts of Ocean and Monmouth counties. Smith is a member of the Republican Party, having switched from the Democratic Party in 1978.
Smith is the dean of New Jersey's congressional delegation and the longest-serving member of Congress in New Jersey's history. He has focused much of his career on promoting human rights abroad, including authoring the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 and several follow-on laws. From 1993 to 2019, he was the top House Republican on the United States Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe. He has used his leadership positions, including chairmanships, to author multiple pieces of legislation focused on human rights and conduct aggressive oversight of human rights abuses, actions that have earned him scorn from abusing nations.


== Early life, education, and early career ==
Smith was born in Rahway, New Jersey, on March 4, 1953. He attended St. Mary's High School in Perth Amboy, where he competed as a runner and wrestler.
After graduating with a B.A. in business administration from Trenton State College (now The College of New Jersey), Smith worked in his family's sporting goods business. In the 1976 election cycle, he managed the Democratic primary challenge of Steven Foley, an attorney and anti-abortion activist, against incumbent Senator Harrison A. Williams; Foley received about 15% of the vote, losing to Williams. In 1978, Smith switched to the Republican Party, and became executive director of the New Jersey Right to Life Committee, a part-time role.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 1978 ====
In 1978, while working at his family's sporting goods store, 25-year-old Smith ran for Congress as a Republican. He lost to longtime Democratic incumbent U.S. Congressman Frank Thompson 61%–37%.


==== 1980 ====
In 1980, Smith ran against Thompson again. Initially, Smith was thought to have a very slim chance of winning, but Thompson was indicted as part of the FBI's Abscam probe. With the race now considered competitive, Republicans considered replacing Smith, but two alternative candidates seen as more competitive, Hamilton mayor John K. Rafferty and 1978 Senate nominee Jeff Bell, declined. Helped by Ronald Reagan's strong performance in the district, Smith defeated Thompson 57%–41%.


==== 1982 ====
In 1982, Smith's district was redrawn to include more Democratic voters and his Democratic opponent was former New Jersey Senate President Joseph P. Merlino, who had directly controlled the redistricting process and run a competitive campaign for governor the year before. It was widely assumed that Smith's 1980 victory over the scandal-plagued Thompson was a fluke, and that he would lose to the better-known Merlino. At the end of one of their debates, Smith approached Merlino to exchange pleasantries. Merlino was quoted as saying "Beat it, kid."
During the campaign, Merlino ran a negative ad comparing Smith to Jimmy Stewart's character in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. In response, Stewart released a statement endorsing Smith and denouncing the ad: "When I played Mr. Smith in that picture, I did not think he was a naive hick. I thought he believed in honesty and integrity in government, the right of the people and the love of his country." Merlino pulled the ad.
Smith won the race with 52.7% of the vote.
Subsequently, a federal court found the 1982 redistricting was impermissible gerrymandering, and Smith's district was redrawn to more closely resemble the one used in 1980. He has not faced another contest that close since.


==== 1984–present ====
From 1984 to 2016, Smith won reelection with over 60% of the vote.
In 2006, Smith's 66% was the highest percentage for any Republican in the New Jersey delegation.
In 2008, Smith defeated college history professor Joshua M. Zeitz, 66%–32%.

In 2010, Smith received 69.4% of the vote, ahead of Democratic nominee Howard Kleinhendler, Libertarian nominee Joe Siano, Green Party nominee Steven Welzer, and American Renaissance Movement nominee David Meiswinkle.
In 2018, Smith defeated Democratic nominee Joshua Welle with 55% of the vote to Welle's 43%. Smith was the only Republican to win a congressional race in New Jersey that year, reducing the GOP to its smallest presence in New Jersey's House delegation since 1918. This was Smith's closest election since 1982.
In 2020, Smith defeated Democratic nominee Stephanie Schmid.
In 2022, Smith defeated Democratic nominee Matthew Jenkins with 66.9% of the vote.


=== Tenure ===
Smith was ranked the 17th most bipartisan member of the House of Representatives during the 114th United States Congress (and the second most bipartisan from New Jersey) in the Bipartisan Index by the Lugar Center.
In November 1997, Smith was one of 18 House Republicans to co-sponsor a resolution by Bob Barr that sought to launch an impeachment inquiry against President Bill Clinton. The resolution did not specify any charges or allegations. This was an early effort to impeach Clinton, predating the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal. That scandal led to a more serious effort to impeach Clinton in 1998. On October 8, 1998, Smith voted in favor of legislation that was passed to open an impeachment inquiry. On December 19, 1998, he voted in favor of all four proposed articles of impeachment against Clinton (only two of which received the needed majority of votes to be adopted).
It was revealed in October 2015 that intern applicants for Smith's office were required to rate "27 different personalities, organizations, and political issues, to indicate whether they tend to agree with them, disagree with them, or have no opinion or knowledge of them". Personalities and organizations included Rachel Maddow, the Pope, Planned Parenthood, and The National Right to Life Committee.
Smith has been nominated, and confirmed, twice to serve as a member of the United States delegation to the United Nations General Assembly. He was nominated by President Barack Obama in 2015 for the 70th session and by President Donald Trump in 2017 for the 72nd session.
Smith voted against both articles in the first impeachment of Donald Trump, and the sole article of the second impeachment of Donald Trump.
Smith did not join the majority of Republican members of Congress who signed an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election. Smith voted to certify both Arizona's and Pennsylvania's results in the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count.
On February 4, 2021, Smith voted with 10 other House Republicans and all House Democrats to strip Marjorie Taylor Greene of her House Education and Labor Committee and House Budget Committee assignments, in response to controversial political statements she had made. On November 5, 2021, Smith was one of 13 House Republicans to break with their party and vote with a majority of Democrats in favor of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.

Veterans
In January 2001, Smith became chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, and pushed for policies Republican leadership opposed, including voting against the Republican, and for the Democratic, budget resolution, because the latter included more spending on veterans programs. In 2004, Smith refused to endorse the Republican budget proposal, unless it included more money for veterans. In a congressional hearing, Smith articulated his belief that the Bush Administration's budget request was $1.2 billion less than the Department of Veterans Affairs actually required, embarrassing the administration and Republican congressional leadership. During his four years as committee chair, Smith wrote 22 bills addressing veterans' issues. His unwillingness to follow the party line resulted in the House Republican Caucus removing him from his chairmanship (and from the committee altogether) in January 2005, at the beginning of the 109th Congress, with the chairmanship going to Steve Buyer instead, two years short of the normal six-year term. Veterans' groups such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars and Paralyzed Veterans of America praised Smith and criticized the decision to remove him.


==== Legislation ====

On May 6, 2014, Smith introduced the bill International Megan's Law to Prevent Demand for Child Sex Trafficking (H.R. 4573; 113th Congress), which would require the notification of foreign governments when an American registered as a sex offender of children travels to their country.
As of April 2020, FiveThirtyEight reported that Smith voted in line with Trump's position 67.7% of the time, the third-lowest percentage among Republican members of Congress after fellow New Jerseyan Jeff Van Drew and Brian Fitzpatrick.
In March 2021, Smith was one of eight Republicans to join the House majority in passing the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021.


=== Committee assignments ===
Committee on Foreign Affairs
Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, and Human Rights (Ranking member)
Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere
Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission
Congressional-Executive Commission on China


=== Caucus memberships ===
Republican Main Street Partnership
Republican Governance Group
Problem Solvers Caucus


== Political positions ==


=== Abortion ===
Smith is strongly anti-abortion. He is a co-chairman of the Congressional Pro-Life Caucus, and served as co-chair of the Trump Administration's Pro-Life Coalition. He supports the Mexico City policy, which blocks U.S. federal funding for non-governmental organizations that provide abortion counseling or referrals, advocate to decriminalize abortion or expand abortion services. In 2000, he voted for the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2000. In December 2023, Smith signed a letter of support to Tommy Tuberville, thanking him for his nine-month hold on more than 400 military promotions over the Pentagon's abortion policy.
Smith expressed support for the Stupak-Pitts Amendment, an amendment to America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009.
Smith has introduced various forms of the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, starting with the original proposal in 2011. The 2011 proposal prohibited federal funds from being used for health benefits that cover abortion, unless in the case of rape, incest or if the woman could die. It also disqualified abortions from being written off on taxes. In 2013, Smith reintroduced the proposal, which further restricted insurance coverage of abortions. The bill passed the House but has yet to be voted on by the Senate.


=== Domestic violence ===
Smith voted for the original 1994 Violence Against Women Act, and co-sponsored the reauthorization bills of 2000 and 2005, the latter of which provided $1.6 billion for investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against women, imposed automatic and mandatory restitution on those convicted, and allowed civil redress in cases prosecutors chose to leave un-prosecuted. Smith voted against reauthorizing the act in 2013, due to the Senate version of the bill's cutting of funding for the Trafficking in Persons Office at the State Department, which Smith's Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 created.


=== Environment ===
As of 2020, Smith has a lifetime score of 62% on the National Environmental Scorecard of the League of Conservation Voters, the second-highest of any sitting Republican member (after Brian Fitzpatrick). He has said, "Climate change is a global challenge that must be addressed with a global solution."
Smith also opposes offshore drilling, particularly in New Jersey.
Smith backed a carbon emissions trading bill to tackle climate change, one of only eight Republicans in the House to do so.


=== Guns ===
Smith opposes concealed carry. In 2016, he was one of four Republicans to receive a 100% rating from the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and has generally received low or intermediate ratings from pro-gun organizations Gun Owners of America and the National Rifle Association. Smith did not co-sponsor the Brady Campaign's proposed legislation to expand background checks for gun purchasers.
Smith was one of five Republicans to co-sponsor HR 8 in the 116th Congress, which would require mandatory background checks for gun sales.
Smith called the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting "tragic beyond words", and said, "The terrorist's motive, if linked to radical Islamist ideology, underscores the escalating national and worldwide threat from global jihad."
In the wake of the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, Smith co-sponsored a ban on bump stocks with Leonard Lance.


=== Health care ===
Smith has written three major laws to address autism, including the most recent Autism CARES which included $1.3 billion in funding for research, services and supports and requires a report on aging out.
On May 9, 2014, Smith introduced the bill Autism CARES Act of 2014, a bill that would amend the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize research, surveillance, and education activities related to autism spectrum disorders (autism) conducted by various agencies within the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
On May 9, 2019, Smith was one of only three Republicans who voted for HR 986, a measure supported by all voting House Democrats intended to maintain protections of those with preexisting medical conditions to have continued access to affordable medical insurance under the existing provisions of the Affordable Care Act. Five weeks earlier, he had voted with seven other Republicans to pass a resolution condemning the Trump administration's efforts by Department of Justice to have the courts invalidate Obamacare.
Smith has been a longtime promoter of the medically unrecognized "chronic Lyme disease", and has pushed for the medical establishment to recognize the condition. The condition, not to be confused with genuine Lyme disease, is generally rejected by medical professionals, and its promotion is generally seen as health fraud. In 2019, Smith proposed an investigation into whether the Pentagon had released "weaponized" ticks infected with Lyme disease into the environment between 1950 and 1975. Scientists identified this proposal, which Congress did not adopt, as based on a conspiracy theory and claimed that an investigation was unnecessary and a poor use of funds.


=== Human rights ===

Smith advocates for human rights, serving on numerous committees that seek to impact both national and international laws and legislation. He has stated that the bills he introduces to the house are meant to make the U.S. take "human rights seriously".
In 1999, Smith proposed, as part of the American Embassy Security Act, to stop a U.S. sponsored program which provided training to Royal Ulster Constabulary with the FBI, due to claims of human rights violations, i. e., harassment of defense attorneys representing republicans in Northern Ireland. However, he voted "no" on a bill that halts arms sales to Saudi Arabia and removes troops from Yemen.
He supported the return David Goldman's son in the Goldman child abduction case, which involved a trip to Brazil. Smith acknowledges the Armenian genocide, and has made calls for the U.S. to recognize it.
In 2017, Smith co-sponsored an effort to prioritize human rights in Azerbaijan with Jim McGovern. The H. Res. 537 act also seeks to see further implementation of the Magnitsky Act regarding Azerbaijani officials, as well as a call for Azerbaijan to release all political prisoners. He supported efforts to deport Jakiw Palij, a denaturalized former American citizen residing in New York who failed to disclose he worked as a guard at a concentration camp in Nazi Germany. Palij was deported to Germany in 2018 and died in 2019. Smith condemned Turkey's wide-ranging crackdown on dissent following a failed July 2016 coup.


==== China ====
Smith has held congressional hearings and has proposed bills regarding human rights violations, specifically around women's sexual health, activism and religious groups, in China. He staunchly opposes the forced sterilization and forced abortions being implemented by the Chinese government towards women regarding China's one-child policy. Regarding the victimization of these women, Smith stated that "the agony that those women carry with them is beyond words. They talk about the pain that they carry for their child and for the violation by the state." In response, Smith wrote a bill, which was put into law in 1999, making it illegal for the U.S. to issue visas to foreign nationals who have been involved in forced abortion or sterilization.

Smith held a congressional hearing regarding the disappearance of blind Chinese activist Chen Guangcheng. He attempted, in 2011, to visit Chen in China, when the activist was under house arrest, but was not granted permission. In response to the violations towards Chen and his family, Smith sponsored the China Democracy Promotion Act of 2011, which sought to prevent known Chinese human rights violators from entering the U.S.
In the wake of the 2014 Hong Kong class boycott campaign and Umbrella Movement, Smith co-sponsored the bipartisan Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, supporting Hong Kong's ongoing autonomy and the human rights of those Hong Kongers involved in nonviolent protests and/or those who have had their rights violated by the Chinese government.
In November 2018, Smith raised the issue of Xinjiang internment camps and human rights abuses against the Uyghurs. Smith said: "The internment of over a million Uyghurs and other Muslims in China is a staggering evil and should be treated by the international community as a crime against humanity. The Chinese government's creation of a vast system of what can only be called concentration camps cannot be tolerated in the 21st century."
On July 13, 2020, Smith, along with three other U.S. politicians, was sanctioned by the Chinese government for "interfering in China’s internal affairs" through their condemnation of human rights abuses in Xinjiang. On August 10, 2020, Smith, along with 10 other U.S. individuals, was sanctioned by the Chinese government for "behaving badly on Hong Kong-related issues".
In October 2022, Politico reported that Smith criticized some US-based financial executives attending the Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit, saying that companies "that trumpet their so-called 'Environmental, Social and Governance Principles' at home are quick to discard these 'values' for a chance to make a profit from China."


==== South Korea ====
Smith has indicated his serious concern on the amendment of the Development of Inter-Korean Relations Act in South Korea which passed the South Korean National Assembly on December 14, 2020. It penalizes activists who send anti-North Korean material across the border as balloon propaganda. It was passed by the super-majority of the ruling party of President Moon Jae-in who is keen to improve cross-border ties. Smith stated that "While I would hope that members of Korea's Democratic Party would see how damaging this proposed legislation is to democratic principles and human rights, and thus reverse course, in the event that they pass such a law, I call upon our State Department to critically reevaluate the Republic of Korea's commitment to democratic values in its annual human rights report, as well as in its report on international religious freedom.  It may very well be that we will see South Korea put on a watch list, which would be a very sad development indeed."


==== Religion ====
Smith supports religious rights regarding international human rights. He supports sanctions against Vietnam regarding its treatment of Catholics and China regarding the Uyghurs and Falun Gong.


=== Immigration ===
Smith supported the Indonesian Family Refugee Protection Act in 2012, which would have extended the deadline for Indonesian immigrants to file for citizenship.


=== Intellectual property rights ===
Smith authored the Global Online Freedom Act in 2007, but it did not become law.  The proposed legislation was a bill  "to promote freedom of expression on the Internet, to protect United States businesses from coercion to participate in repression by authoritarian foreign governments, and for other purposes."  Specifically, the bill would prohibit American companies from turning over data about customers residing in "internet restrictive countries." The bill is supported by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and Reporters Without Borders. It is opposed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation.


=== January 6 commission ===
On May 19, 2021, Smith was one of 35 Republicans who joined all Democrats in voting to approve legislation to establish the January 6 commission meant to investigate the U.S. Capitol attack.


=== LGBT rights ===
In 2015, Smith said he did not consider same-sex marriage a fundamental human right as defined by the United Nations.
In July 2022, Smith voted against the Respect for Marriage Act, a bill that required the U.S. federal government to recognize the validity of same-sex marriages.


=== Labor movement ===
Smith supports the Employee Free Choice Act. The AFL-CIO Legislative Scorecard, which tracks support for workers' rights, gives Smith a 61% lifetime rating, ranking him seventh of New Jersey's twelve Representatives, and 195th of the House's 435 Representatives.
The AFL-CIO endorsed Smith for re-election in 2018, calling him one of the "best candidates for working people," due to his support for collective bargaining, opposition to the Janus v. AFSCME Supreme Court decision, and support for infrastructure funding, among other reasons.
As of March 2019, Smith is the only Republican co-sponsor of the Paycheck Fairness Act. He also supported the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, which expanded the scope of the statute of limitations for pay discrimination.
Smith cited the example of Lech Wałęsa and the Solidarity movement as a reason he support unions. He also said of his fellow Republicans, "What my Republican colleagues often don't understand is that labor is a human-rights issue".


=== Marijuana ===
Smith has a "D" rating from NORML regarding his voting record on cannabis-related matters. He has consistently voted against the Veterans Equal Access Amendment, which provides veterans access to information regarding medical marijuana accessibility in their respective states.


=== Veterans affairs ===
Bob Wallace, executive director of the Veterans of Foreign Wars calls Smith "the best friend" of veterans. In 2004, Smith refused to endorse the Republican budget proposal unless it included more money for veterans. In a congressional hearing, Smith publicly articulated his belief that the Bush Administration's budget request was $1.2 billion less than the Department of Veterans Affairs actually required, embarrassing the administration and Republican congressional leadership. In 2005, Smith was removed from his chairmanship and membership on the Veterans Affair Committee for his aggressive role in seeking more funding for veteran-related causes.


=== Science policy ===
Smith supports efforts to provide alternatives to embryonic stem cell research. In 2005, he co-sponsored a bill with Artur Davis to fund the creation of a network of national blood banks to distribute umbilical cord blood for stem cell research.


=== Taxation ===
Smith voted against the 2017 Republican tax legislation backed by Donald Trump; he was one of five Republican representatives from New Jersey who joined Democrats in opposing the bill. Smith opposed the bill as "unfair to the taxpayers of New Jersey" because it dramatically limited the federal reduction of state and local taxes (SALT). and said he would be "forced to oppose" more tax cuts if legislation included a provision permanently extending the $10,000 cap on the SALT deduction.

Thomas Howard Kean Jr. ( KAYN; born September 5, 1968) is an American politician serving as the U.S. representative from New Jersey's 7th congressional district since 2023. He represented New Jersey's 21st legislative district in the New Jersey Senate from 2003 to 2022, serving as minority leader from 2008 to 2022.
From 2001 to 2003, Kean was a member of the New Jersey General Assembly. In 2003, he was elected a New Jersey state senator representing the same district, and in January 2008 he became minority leader of the New Jersey Senate, serving in the position until his term ended in January 2022. After Governor Chris Christie was reelected in 2013, Christie tried and failed to remove him as minority leader. He was frequently mentioned as a potential Republican candidate for governor in the 2017 New Jersey gubernatorial election, but did not seek the nomination.
Kean was the Republican nominee for New Jersey's 7th congressional district in 2020, narrowly losing the general election to incumbent Democrat Tom Malinowski. He defeated Malinowski in a 2022 rematch. Kean was re-elected in 2024, defeating former New Jersey Working Families Party director Sue Altman.


== Early life and education ==
Kean was born in Livingston, New Jersey, on September 5, 1968. His parents are Deborah (née Bye) and Thomas Kean. His father served as governor of New Jersey from 1982 to 1990. His grandfather Robert Kean was a former congressman from New Jersey. Through his father, he is also a descendant of William Livingston, the state's first governor.
Kean grew up on the family's estate in Livingston. He has two siblings. He graduated from the Pingry School.
Kean is also a graduate of Dartmouth College, where he was a member of the Psi Upsilon fraternity, and holds a Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy from Fletcher School at Tufts University.
Kean was an aide to former Congressman Bob Franks and a special assistant at the United States Environmental Protection Agency in the George H. W. Bush administration.


== New Jersey Assembly ==
Kean was appointed to the General Assembly, the lower house of the New Jersey Legislature, in April 2001, to serve out the unexpired term of Alan Augustine, who had resigned on March 21, 2001, for health reasons. He was elected to a full term in the Assembly in November 2001.  In the Assembly, he chaired the Republican Policy Committee and served as vice chair of the State Government Committee.


== New Jersey Senate ==


=== Tenure ===
In March 2003, Kean was appointed to the New Jersey Senate to serve out the unexpired term of Rich Bagger, and won election to that Senate seat in November 2003. In 2004, he was elected Senate Minority Whip, a position he held until 2007. He served in the Senate on the Health, Human Services and Senior Citizens Committee.
Kean was one of six Republicans in the state senate to vote for a 2019 appropriations bill that passed 31 to 6.


==== Committees ====
Commerce
Higher Education
Legislative Oversight
Legislative Services Commission


== 2006 U.S. Senate campaign ==

Kean was the Republican nominee for the United States Senate seat vacated by former U.S. senator and former governor of New Jersey Jon Corzine, a seat that was filled by Corzine's designated replacement, Bob Menendez. Kean won the June 6, 2006, primary against John P. Ginty by a 3–1 margin. He lost the general election to Menendez, 53.3% to 44.3%. The race was the narrowest victory for an incumbent Democrat in the U.S. in an election that saw Democrats retake control of the Senate as part of a nationwide backlash against the Bush administration. He was endorsed by The Courier-Post, The Press of Atlantic City, and Asbury Park Press.


== U.S House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 2000 ====

Kean sought the Republican nomination for New Jersey's 7th congressional district, but lost the primary to Mike Ferguson by about 4,000 votes, finishing second in a field of four candidates.


==== 2020 ====

On April 16, 2019, Kean announced that he was running for New Jersey's 7th congressional district in 2020, challenging first-term Democratic incumbent Tom Malinowski. In the first quarter of 2019, Kean nearly matched Malinowski's fundraising total of over $500,000. In August 2019, Kean was endorsed by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Kean won the Republican primary over token opposition, and narrowly lost to Malinowski in the general election. It was the closest House race in New Jersey and one of the closest in the country; due to the close margin and slow counting of mail-in and provisional ballots, the outcome remained in doubt until nearly two weeks after the election.


==== 2022 ====

Kean announced in February 2021 that he would not seek reelection to the State Senate and immediately became the subject of speculation that he was preparing to run for New Jersey's 7th congressional district again. Malinowski was under scrutiny after his failure to disclose more than 100 stock trades became a national news story and led to a complaint filed with the House Ethics Committee. In redistricting, the 7th district was made more Republican while the neighboring 11th and 5th districts became more solidly Democratic. Kean formally announced his campaign on July 14, 2021, joined by U.S. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. He won the Republican primary in June 2022 and the general election with 51.4% (159,392 votes) to Malinowski's 48.6% (150,701 votes).


==== 2024 ====

Kean won reelection in 2024 against Democratic nominee Sue Altman, a former leader of the New Jersey's Working Families Party.


=== Tenure ===
Kean is a member of the Republican Main Street Partnership, and joined the Problem Solvers Caucus. Kean said he joined the caucus to assure constituents that he remains committed to "working across the aisle". He is a moderate Republican, though detractors have said he could have done more to distance himself from the politics of President Trump.
Critics have called Kean out for holding "Telephone Town Halls", especially Sue Altman, his opponent in the 2024 election. Others counter that Kean's lesser media presence is a strength. Fred Snowflack of Insider New Jersey reported "Dating back to last fall's campaign, most of those griping about Kean's incommunicado ways were the media and voters who probably were not going to support him anyway."
During his 2022 election campaign, Kean, who self-describes as pro-choice, promised voters that he would support abortion rights. After the Dobbs decision, he said "this decision is now best to happen on the state level." During his tenure, he voted against the Women's Health Protection Act which would have codified the abortion rights that the Supreme Court overturned. He voted for the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which would penalize healthcare practitioners who fail to provide care for an infant that is born-alive from an abortion attempt. Kean has expressed support for IVF and introduced legislation to provide income tax credits to people undergoing fertility treatments.
In 2024, Kean, one of 17 House Republicans representing a district that voted for Joe Biden, endorsed Donald Trump.

He was reelected three times, in 2014, 2016, and 2018. Garbarino was a member of the New York Conference of Italian-American State Legislators as an assemblyman.


==== Election history ====


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 2020 ====

Following the announcement that 14-term incumbent Representative Peter T. King would not run for reelection in 2020, Garbarino announced his candidacy for Congress in New York's 2nd congressional district. He ran in the June 23 Republican Party primary, and was endorsed by King, as well as the Nassau County and Suffolk County Republican Parties. He defeated Assemblyman Mike LiPetri, 65% to 35%.

On January 6, 2021, Garbarino did not object to the Electoral College results, saying:The role of Congress is not to overturn the election or to take actions that silence voters. The Constitution is clear, the votes must be counted and certified by the states and Congress has the constitutional obligation to accept those electors and certify each states’ elections. All 50 states have certified their elections and the majority of electors have cast their votes for President-Elect Joe Biden. While I join many Long Islanders in wishing the results were different, Congress does not have the constitutional authority to overturn the election.In March 2021, Garbarino was one of eight House Republicans to vote for the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021.
Garbarino voted against the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, as did every congressional Republican.

Nicole Malliotakis ( MAL-ee-ə-TAH-kiss; born November 11, 1980) is an American politician serving as the U.S. representative for New York's 11th congressional district since 2021. Her constituency covers Staten Island and southern Brooklyn.
Malliotakis is the only Republican representing any part of New York City in Congress, and is one of five female Republican elected officials in New York City, with the other four serving on the New York City Council. In 2020, she defeated incumbent Representative Max Rose. She was the Republican nominee for mayor of New York City in the 2017 election, which she lost to incumbent Democrat Bill de Blasio.


== Early life and education ==
Malliotakis was born on November 11, 1980, in the Manhattan borough of New York City. She moved to Staten Island when she was two years old and grew up in Great Kills, the daughter of immigrant parents; her father is from Greece and her mother from Cuba, having left in 1959 following the rise of Fidel Castro. She was raised in the Greek Orthodox faith.
Malliotakis attended New Dorp High School on Staten Island, and during her senior year was elected class president. She received a B.A. in communications from Seton Hall University and a Master of Business Administration (MBA) from Wagner College.


== Early political career ==
Malliotakis worked as a community liaison for former State Senator John Marchi in 2003–04 and former Governor George Pataki in 2004–06. Before her election, she also worked on state energy policy as the Consolidated Edison Company of New York's public affairs manager.
In November 2015, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida named Malliotakis the New York State chair of his 2016 presidential campaign.


== New York State Assembly ==

In 2010, Malliotakis won the election to represent the 60th District in the New York State Assembly, defeating two-term Democratic incumbent Janele Hyer-Spencer by 10 percentage points. Upon her election to the Assembly, she became the first Greek-American woman elected to office in New York State, the first Cuban-American woman elected to office in New York State, and the first person of Hispanic descent elected from Staten Island. As of January 2018, she was one of only two Republicans from the City of New York serving in the Assembly, along with Michael Reilly. Malliotakis was Brooklyn's only Republican lawmaker.
In October 2011, Malliotakis submitted an amicus curiae brief in support of an American Automobile Association lawsuit against the Port Authority in federal court, arguing that recent toll increases were illegal. She successfully brought an Article 78 proceeding in New York State Supreme Court to get the Port Authority to disclose the results of an economic impact study on the effect the toll increases had had on business at New York Container Terminal.
Malliotakis was reelected in 2012 with 61% of the vote and in 2014 with 73% of the vote in both Brooklyn and Staten Island. After U.S. Representative Michael Grimm's resignation in 2014, she was mentioned as a top contender for his seat, but decided against a run.
She made elder rights a hallmark of her tenure and successfully fought to keep a senior center in Staten Island from being closed.
Malliotakis held a series of forums on the MTA Payroll Mobility Tax and its alleged negative impact on small businesses, nonprofit organizations, and private schools. The New York state legislature and Governor Andrew Cuomo subsequently enacted significant repeals. Malliotakis fought for relief from the September 2011 toll increase on Port Authority bridges, calling for divestment of costly non-essential real estate holdings and highlighting mismanaged contributions to community organizations.


== 2017 New York City mayoral campaign ==

On April 25, 2017, Malliotakis filed as a Republican candidate for mayor of New York City in the 2017 election. She won the Republican nomination unopposed after businessman Paul Massey dropped out in June over money concerns. On November 7, 2017, Malliotakis lost the election to incumbent Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio, 66–28%. She received 70% of the vote in Staten Island.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 2020 ====

In 2020, Malliotakis ran as the Republican nominee for New York's 11th congressional district against incumbent Democrat Max Rose. Her state assembly district included much of the eastern portion of the congressional district.
The race was considered the only potentially competitive House race in New York City. The 11th has long been the most conservative district of the 12 that divide New York City; it is the only one with a Cook Partisan Voting Index less than D+20, and since the 1990s it has been the only New York City-based district where Republicans usually do well. The GOP had held the seat for all but one term since 1980 before Rose won the seat in an upset in the 2018 midterm elections. The two engaged in a contentious race, with many attack ads on both sides.
Malliotakis endorsed incumbent Republican President Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election; in turn, Trump announced, "Nicole has my Complete & Total Endorsement!" She embraced Trump's backing, saying, "I am honored by President Trump's endorsement and his words of support...I plan to defeat Max Rose and return New York's 11th Congressional District to commonsense leadership."
Malliotakis declared victory upon taking a commanding lead in election day returns on November 3. Rose did not immediately concede, citing absentee votes yet to be counted. As it became apparent that Malliotakis's lead was too large to overcome, Rose conceded on November 12. Malliotakis took 53% of the vote to Rose's 47%.


==== 2022 ====

In 2022, Malliotakis ran for a second term against former Democratic congressman Max Rose in a rematch of her previous race. She declared victory on election night, and Rose conceded defeat shortly afterward; Malliotakis took 62% of the vote to Rose's 38%.


==== 2024 ====

In 2024, Nicole Malliotakis was re-elected for a third term in the United States House of Representatives, defeating Democratic challenger Andrea Morse. Nicole Malliotakis garnered 64.49% of the vote, compared to Morse's 35.12%, securing a decisive victory in New York's 11th Congressional District.


=== Tenure ===
In January 2021, Malliotakis was appointed as the Assistant Minority Whip for the Republican Conference, the House Committees On Foreign Affairs and Transportation & Infrastructure, as well as the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus.
On February 4, 2021, Malliotakis joined 10 other Republican House members and all Democrats in voting to strip Marjorie Taylor Greene of her House Education and Labor Committee and House Budget Committee assignments in response to controversial political statements she had made. Malliotakis called Greene’s comments "extraordinarily offensive and hurtful to thousands of 9/11 families and first responders, our Jewish community and many others in my district."
On November 5, 2021, Malliotakis joined 12 other Republicans in voting for the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which passed the House 228–206.
In January 2023, Malliotakis was selected to serve on the House Committee on Ways and Means in the 118th Congress; she is the only House member from New York City to serve on the committee this term and the first Republican from the city to serve on the committee in 30 years.

== Political positions ==
During her time in Congress, the American Conservative Union, a political action committee (PAC) supporting American conservatism, gave her a 66% score for voting in line with its positions while the American Civil Liberties Union, a PAC associated with American liberalism and libertarianism, gave her a 0% score. Upon her election to Congress, Malliotakis indicated an intent to join other freshman Republicans in forming a counterweight to oppose the so-called "Squad" of progressive Democrats; the coalition is known as the Freedom Force.


=== Abortion ===
As a state legislator, she received a 100% rating in 2011 from the New York State Right to Life Committee, an anti-abortion PAC, and a 50% rating in 2019 from Planned Parenthood Empire State, a pro-abortion rights PAC, indicating how often she voted with their positions. During her run for mayor, she said, "I am not against abortion." She does not support overturning Roe v. Wade, but has voted against taxpayer-funded abortions and against New York state's late-term abortion bill. During her run for mayor, she did not identify as pro-life or pro-choice, saying, "it's not black or white. I think there's a lot of things that go into a decision of that magnitude." But in her congressional campaign, she identified as pro-life, even as she reiterated that she does not "hold black-and-white views" on abortion.


=== COVID-19 ===
Malliotakis voted against the American Rescue Plan in 2021, but after its passage, she touted aspects of the legislation as one of her "achievements".


=== Donald Trump ===
Malliotakis voted for Trump in the 2016 presidential election. During her mayoral campaign, she said that she regretted voting for Trump and that she would "write in Marco Rubio so that I could tell you I voted for Marco Rubio." In 2020, however, she endorsed and said that she voted for Trump. 
Shortly after Joe Biden defeated Trump in the 2020 presidential election, Malliotakis refused to acknowledge Biden's win, echoing Trump's refusal to concede the election. In the aftermath, Malliotakis supported Trump's false claims of election fraud.
On January 6, 2021, Malliotakis voted to object to counting either Arizona's or Pennsylvania's electoral votes in the 2020 presidential election based on disproved allegations of voter fraud and unconstitutional procedures. On January 9, more than 300 protesters, including seven New York City and New York State elected officials, gathered outside her Brooklyn office to call for her to either vote to impeach Trump or resign. On January 13, she voted against Trump's second impeachment for inciting the storming of the Capitol.
She again endorsed Trump in 2024.
In the 119th United States Congress, she co-sponsored a pair of resolutions meant to expunge Trump's impeachments.


=== Gun policy ===
On legislation relating to firearms and gun ownership, Malliotakis received an 8% rating from the Gun Owners of America, a PAC opposing gun control laws, and a "C-" grade from the NRA Political Victory Fund, another PAC opposing gun control legislation.


=== Health care ===
She has criticized the Affordable Care Act, saying it is "strangling the business community."


=== Immigration ===
Malliotakis has repeatedly called for the implementation of additional security measures on the border between the United States and Mexico.  She opposes sanctuary city status for undocumented immigrants in New York City.  While in the State Assembly, Malliotakis said she was "against New York State extending licenses for illegal immigrants".


=== Infrastructure ===
On November 5, 2021, Malliotakis was among the 13 House Republicans who voted with a majority of Democrats to pass the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, a $1.2 trillion infrastructure spending bill.


=== LGBTQ+ rights ===
After originally opposing same-sex marriage, Malliotakis said she regretted that position and voted to support adoptions by same-sex parents and to protect estate rights for married same-sex couples. She repeatedly voted against the Gender Expression Non-Discrimination Act, a New York state law banning discrimination on the basis of gender expression, which she said was too concerned with "bathrooms."  Malliotakis also voted against the Equality Act. 
On July 19, 2022, Malliotakis and 46 other Republican Representatives voted for the Respect for Marriage Act, which would codify the right to same-sex marriage in federal law. She said, "In 2017, I expressed my deep regret for voting against a bill legalizing same-sex marriage in New York State while in the state Assembly six years prior. Over the past decade, I have attended two weddings of couples who deserve equal recognition and protection under the law." On December 8, 2022, she and 38 other Republican representatives voted for the final passage of the Respect for Marriage Act.
She has been endorsed by Log Cabin Republicans, a Republican PAC in favor of same-sex marriage and other LGBTQ rights.


=== New York policy ===
Malliotakis has opposed congestion pricing in the most congested parts of Manhattan. In 2024, she said she was looking for "any legislative and legal option" to stop the congestion pricing plan.
Malliotakis opposed raising fees on plastic bags in New York and supports reducing bridge tolls. She proposed a plan to cut property taxes for seniors and to limit increases on property taxes.

Nicholas A. Langworthy (born February 27, 1981) is an American politician serving as the U.S. representative for New York's 23rd district since 2023. He was formerly the chair of the New York State Republican Committee. Langworthy was named chair of the committee in July 2019 after having chaired the Erie County, New York Republican Committee since 2010. He was the youngest state chair in party history.


== Early life ==
Langworthy was born in Jamestown, New York.  He attended the Pine Valley Central School in his hometown of South Dayton and graduated in 1999. After graduation, he attended Niagara University, where he established the university's branch of the College Republicans. He graduated from Niagara with a bachelor's degree in political science and chaired the New York College Republicans.


== Early political career ==


=== Early career ===
After interning at Governor George Pataki's office and running a congressional campaign for Brett Sommer in 2000, Langworthy became a staffer for Congressman Thomas M. Reynolds. He managed Reynolds's successful reelection campaigns in 2004 and 2006. While working for Reynolds, Langworthy met his future wife, Erin Baker, who also worked on Reynolds's staff. Langworthy later managed the successful 2008 campaign of Representative Chris Lee and served as Lee's district office director until May 2010.
Langworthy is the founder and president of a polling firm, Liberty Opinion Research.


=== Erie County Republican Committee ===
Erie County Republican Committee Chair James P. Domagalski resigned his chairmanship in 2010 to run for the New York State Senate. An early front-runner for the county chairship, Langworthy made himself as visible as possible on the county and state Republican scenes. Langworthy unanimously won a special election for the chairship, becoming the youngest chair of either political party in Erie County's history. He was the only Republican county chair to endorse Carl Paladino in the Republican gubernatorial primary in 2010; he emerged as a political powerhouse when Paladino won the primary.  Paladino's primary upset, together with the Republicans' successful effort to take control of the Erie County legislature, led Buffalo News chief political columnist Bob McCarthy to call Langworthy the "GOP's Young Elder".
In 2016, President-elect Donald Trump announced that Langworthy would serve on the executive committee of his transition team. Langworthy had been a vocal supporter of Trump's presidential campaign.
In September 2019, it was announced that Langworthy would be succeeded as Erie County chair by Boston, New York Republican chair Karl J. Simmeth Jr.


=== New York State Republican Committee ===

In 2018, Langworthy began campaigning for the chairship of the New York State Republican Committee against incumbent state chairman Ed Cox. On May 20, 2019, after Monroe County Republican Chair Bill Reilich announced his support for Langworthy, Cox announced that he was withdrawing his candidacy for a new term as chair; the Democrat and Chronicle reported that Langworthy was "poised to become" the next chair of the Republican Committee. On July 1, 2019, Langworthy was named chair of the New York State Republican Committee. He is the youngest state chair in party history.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 2022 ====

In June 2022, U.S. Representative Chris Jacobs, who was running in New York's 23rd congressional district, announced that he would withdraw from the race and not seek reelection. Langworthy subsequently announced his candidacy for the seat, which represents portions of the Buffalo suburbs and most of the Southern Tier. His home in Pendleton, near Niagara Falls, had been in the 27th district before it was eliminated in redistricting.
Langworthy won the August 24 Republican primary—the real contest in this heavily Republican district—defeating Carl Paladino. While Paladino dominated the Buffalo suburbs, Langworthy swamped him in the Southern Tier. In the general election, Langworthy defeated Democratic nominee Max Della Pia.


=== Caucus memberships ===
Republican Main Street Partnership


=== Tenure ===
On June 11, 2024, Langworthy voted (at 6:36 in video) against including H.R.1282 - MAJ Richard Star Act in the FY 25 NDAA.  This despite the fact that he is listed as a co-sponsor of the bill.


== Personal life ==
Langworthy's wife, Erin Baker Langworthy, ran unsuccessfully for Amherst, New York Town Board in 2017. She served as finance chair of the Erie County Republican Committee.

Claudia L. Tenney (born February 4, 1961) is an American attorney and politician serving as the U.S. representative for New York's 24th congressional district since 2023. Previously, she represented the 22nd district from 2017 to 2019 and from 2021 to 2023, and sat in the New York State Assembly from 2011 to 2016. As a member of the Republican Party, Tenney is an outspoken supporter of President Donald Trump.
In 2014, she challenged incumbent U.S. Representative Richard L. Hanna in the Republican primary and lost. Tenney was elected to Congress in 2016 after Hanna retired. In 2018, Tenney's unsuccessful race against Democratic Party candidate Anthony Brindisi attracted national attention due to its competitiveness and controversial public statements Tenney had made earlier that year. Tenney's rematch against Brindisi in 2020 was even closer, leading to a lengthy recount. By the time the judge overseeing the recount ruled in Tenney's favor, the 117th United States Congress had already been in session for a month.


== Early life and education ==
Tenney was born and raised in New Hartford, New York. Her parents were Cynthia and New York State Supreme Court Justice John R. Tenney. She attended New Hartford High School, where she played basketball and curling and competed in horseback riding. She has a B.A. from Colgate University and a J.D. from the University of Cincinnati College of Law.


== Early career ==
Early in her career, Tenney was the only American employed by the Consulate General of Yugoslavia. She acted as intermediary between ABC Sports and the Yugoslavian government leading up to the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo.
Tenney was a co-owner of Mid-York Press, a commercial printing company started by her mother's family in 1946. Mid-York Press is in Sherburne, in Chenango County.
Tenney maintained a private law practice in Clinton. Before owning her own firm, she was a partner at the Utica-area law firm of Groben, Gilroy, Oster and Saunders.
In January 2001, Tenney began co-hosting Common Cents, a radio and television program that aired weekly across Oneida and most of Herkimer County. In February 2010, she began co-hosting "First Look" on WIBX 950 Radio.


== Early political involvement ==
In 2002, New York State Assemblyman David R. Townsend Jr. won reelection and asked Tenney to become his legal counsel and Chief of Staff. Though she was going through a divorce at the time, she agreed to take the positions part-time so she could continue operating her law practice and her family-owned newspaper.
In 2009, Tenney ran for Oneida County Surrogate Court Judge as a Republican against incumbent Democrat Louis Gigliotti. She received 45% of the vote to Gigliotti's 55%.


== New York State Assembly ==
After Townsend launched a campaign for Oneida County Sheriff in 2010, Tenney decided to run for his Assembly seat. She defeated Oneida County Legislator George Joseph in the September Republican primary and was unopposed in the November general election, becoming the first woman to represent the district.
Tenney represented the 115th Assembly District from 2011 to 2013 and the 101st Assembly District from 2013 to 2017. In 2011, Tenney voted against the Marriage Equality Act. In 2012, Tenney was one of 18 cosponsors of the Internet Protection Act, a bill intended to fight online bullying, which did not pass. Also in 2012, the Conservative Party of New York State gave her an award for being the state's most conservative legislator. She voted against the 2013 gun control law known as the NY SAFE Act, which she called an "assault on upstaters." In 2014, the New York Public Interest Research Group (NYPIRG) claimed Tenney had missed 480 votes, the third-highest number of any assemblymember. WRVO, a National Public Radio affiliate in Oswego, fact-checked NYPIRG's claim and found that she had a 95% attendance record from 2011 to 2016 and had missed 6% of the votes taken during that period.
According to Syracuse.com, "Tenney was a vocal critic of a revenue-sharing deal the Turning Stone Resort Casino in Verona signed with New York state in 2013, in which the Oneida Indian National won exclusive rights to run casinos in a 10-county region of Central New York." Later, a Super PAC "with ties to the Oneida Indian nation" opposed her 2014 and 2016 congressional bids. Tenney voted against the 2013 state constitutional amendment that authorized full-fledged casinos on non-Indian lands.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 2014 ====

In 2014, Tenney ran for the Republican nomination for New York's 22nd congressional district, losing the June 24 primary to incumbent Republican Richard L. Hanna by six points, 47–53%. Tenney ran to the right of Hanna.


==== 2016 ====

Tenney again sought election to Congress from the 22nd District in the 2016 elections. Hanna retired weeks later, denying that the prospect of a primary rematch with Tenney was a factor. Tenney was endorsed by the Conservative Party of New York State, the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List, the Citizens United Victory Fund, and New Yorkers for Constitutional Freedoms PAC. Hanna did not endorse her.
Tenney won a three-way Republican primary on June 28, 2016. She defeated Democrat Kim Myers and Independent/Reform Party candidate Martin Babinec in the November general election with 44% of the vote to Myers's 39% and Babinec's 13%.


==== 2018 ====

On March 3, 2018, Tenney confirmed that she would seek reelection in 2018. The Democratic Party nominated New York State Assemblymember Anthony Brindisi of nearby Utica, who had served alongside Tenney in the Assembly. Brindisi outraised Tenney, ending the year with $581,851 to Tenney's $573,486. In March 2018, The Hill wrote that Tenney was "embracing President Trump's confrontational style." In August, Trump spoke at a fundraiser for Tenney in Utica, the first time a president had visited the Mohawk Valley in nearly 70 years.
On election night, Brindisi led by 1,293 votes. By November 20, Brindisi's lead grew to over 3,900 votes, exceeding the number of outstanding absentee ballots. On November 21, Tenney told local radio station WUTQ-FM that it was unlikely she would overtake Brindisi, and agreed to help with the transition, but said that she wanted to see every ballot counted. She conceded a week later, on November 28. Her defeat made New York's 22nd congressional district the most pro-Trump congressional district in the nation flipped by a Democrat in 2018.


==== 2020 ====

Tenney sought election to Congress in New York's 22nd congressional district once again in 2020. She won the Republican primary and challenged incumbent Anthony Brindisi in the general election. As of December 2, Tenney held a 12-vote lead in the general election; the race was one of two U.S. House races that remained unresolved. On December 8, a New York state judge ordered a districtwide recanvass of all ballots, including provisional ballots and disputed ballots that were not included in the original count.
On February 5, 2021, Tenney was declared the winner of the election by 109 votes. She appeared to get a boost from President Trump, who won the district with 54.7% of the vote. She assumed office on February 11, 2021, nearly a month after most of her colleagues were sworn in.


==== 2022 ====

Initial redistricting maps split NY-22 between several different districts. Tenney announced that she would run in the new 23rd district, which covers the western part of the Southern Tier. Although Tenney did not live in that district, she pointed out that her family's business was based in Chenango County. However, the initial redistricting maps were challenged in court and replaced with maps drawn by a special master. Tenney announced that she would instead run in the 24th district, which runs along the Lake Ontario coast; she does not reside in that district either. She won the Republican primary with 54% of the vote, and handily won election in the strongly Republican district with 64% of the vote.


=== Contributors and PACs ===
During the 2021-22 campaign fundraising period, Tenney received $28,750 from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel lobbying group, which was her top contributor. During the same period, she received approximately $2 million from a combination of large individual contributions and PACs, accounting for 63.64% of total fundraising. Tenney did not self-finance.


=== Tenure and political positions ===
In a radio interview shortly after the February 2018 Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida, Tenney baselessly claimed that "so many of these people that commit the mass murders end up being Democrats". In a follow-up interview, she said, "This problem occurs across all sectors, with all types of people. It isn't just Republicans who commit all these terrible crimes. It is across all sectors and it is people who are typically mentally unstable who are committing a lot of the crimes that we're seeing."
When reports emerged that Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson's office had ordered a $31,000 dining room table set with taxpayer funds, Tenney blamed the "deep state" for the expenditure, adding, "I know that Ben Carson did not order that table. It has nothing to do with him. He comes from, you know, poverty."
In March 2017, Tenney voted to reverse the FCC privacy rule that blocked ISPs from selling customer browsing history without customers' permission.
In November 2017, Tenney introduced the No Pensions for Corrupt Politicians Act, which would "close a loophole that has allowed corrupt members of Congress to collect federal pensions after they are convicted of crimes."
In April 2018, Tenney signed a letter calling for criminal investigations into a number of former Obama administration officials and high-ranking Justice Department officials. The letter accused former FBI Director James Comey of leaking classified information, 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton of concealing payments for the Steele Dossier, and Loretta Lynch of threatening whistle-blowers who had anti-Clinton information. The letter also accused former acting attorney general Sally Yates, former deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe, former acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente, former senior counterintelligence official Peter Strzok and FBI attorney Lisa Page of criminal wrongdoing.
Tenney was a member of the Climate Solutions Caucus. In 2016, she cast doubt on the scientific consensus on climate change, saying, "The science is not determined. It's not certain." In 2017, she supported President Trump's decision to leave the Paris Agreement.
In March 2021, along with all other Senate and House Republicans, she voted against the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.
At a January 5, 2021 rally in Georgia, President Donald Trump falsely claimed the votes in Tenney's race against Anthony Brindisi were being counted fraudulently (at the time, the Tenney-Brindisi race was the nation's only uncalled 2020 congressional race). Tenney shared a video of Trump's speech and did not challenge or dispute Trump's claims. In February 2021, following the U.S. Capitol attack, Tenney said she did not know whether she would have voted to count the electoral votes from the states Biden won in 2020, but that she would have voted against Trump's second impeachment. In May 2021, Tenney falsely suggested that the 2020 presidential election might have been "stolen"; there is no evidence of any meaningful fraud in the election.
In September 2024, Tenney sponsored bill H.R. 9495, "Stop Terror-Financing and Tax Penalties on American Hostages Act", which would allow the U.S. Treasury Secretary to designate any nonprofit as a “terrorist supporting organization” and revoke its tax-exempt status. The bill has been opposed by American Civil Liberties Union and other organizations, who have argued that it could be invoked to punish political opponents and stifle free speech.


==== Health care ====
On May 4, 2017, Tenney voted for the American Health Care Act (AHCA), a bill that passed the House of Representatives and died in the Senate. It would have rewritten many regulations of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and eliminated the individual mandate and federal protections for preexisting conditions in favor of high-risk pools. Tenney also voted for a portion of the AHCA that targeted Medicaid funding by prohibiting Medicaid-related property taxes. The provision applied only to New York State, and only to counties outside of New York City. Tenney argued the overall bill would lower insurance costs, including insurance premiums and related taxes.
In 2021, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Tenney opposed the Biden administration's vaccine mandate for companies with more than 100 employees, calling it "unconstitutional".


==== Islamic Republic of Iran ====
Tenney opposes misogynistic laws of the Islamic Republic of Iran and on January 9, 2023, introduced a bill in the House to condemn its government, "H.Con.Res.7 – Condemning the Iranian regime's human rights abuses against the brave women and men of Iran peacefully demonstrating in more than 133 cities". The bill cites the Mahsa Amini protests.


==== Taxes ====
Tenney voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which Trump signed into law in December 2017. The law's main provisions include a reduction of the top personal income tax rate from 39.6% to 37%, the elimination of the ACA's individual mandate, the limitation of the state and local tax deduction to $10,000 of taxable income, an increase in the standard deduction, and a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. The reduction of the corporate tax rate is permanent; the personal income tax cuts are temporary. In October 2017, Tenney joined other members of Congress and Ivanka Trump at an event to advocate for doubling the child tax credit; this provision was included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.


==== LGBT rights ====
Tenney was one of the 14 co-sponsors of the "Protect Children's Innocence Act", which would make giving transgender minors gender-affirming care a class C felony.
Tenney was the sole member of New York's House delegation to vote against the Respect for Marriage Act, which would codify Obergefell v. Hodges.
In the fall of 2022, after an attacker fractured the skull of Paul Pelosi, the husband of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a number of Republican politicians circulated a baseless allegation that the attacker was a male prostitute—among them, Tenney, who posted on her Twitter account, with the comment "LOL", a doctored photograph of a group of young men holding hammers next to a gay pride flag.


==== Gun control ====
In 2017, Tenney co-sponsored legislation that would substantially eliminate National Firearms Act restrictions on obtaining or possessing gun silencers. After the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, she said she still planned to support the bill.


==== Immigration ====
Tenney sponsored H.R. 6202, the American Tech Workforce Act of 2021, introduced by Representative Jim Banks. The legislation would have established a wage floor for the high-skill H-1B visa program, thereby significantly reducing employer dependence on the program. The bill would have also eliminated the Optional Practical Training program that allows foreign graduates to stay and work in the United States. This bill died in committee.


==== Caucus memberships ====
Congressional Caucus on Turkey and Turkish Americans


== Personal life ==
Tenney is a resident of New Hartford, New York. She and her ex-husband, Wayne Cleary Jr., have one son, Wayne "Trey" Ralph Cleary III. In 2009, the younger Cleary received an appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps in May 2013.
Tenney is a Presbyterian.

Gregory Francis Murphy (born March 5, 1963) is an American politician and urologist representing North Carolina's 3rd congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives since 2019. He served as a representative in the North Carolina General Assembly from 2015 to 2019.


== Early life and education ==
Murphy was raised in Raleigh, North Carolina, and attended Needham B. Broughton High School. After high school, he attended Davidson College as an Edward Crosland Stuart Scholar. He then completed medical school at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he graduated with honors and as a member of the Alpha Omega Alpha medical honor society.
After completing his residency in urology and renal transplantation at the University of Kentucky, Murphy and his wife settled in Greenville, North Carolina, where he began his medical practice.


== Medical career ==
Murphy has traveled as a medical missionary. When he was 20 years old, he spent a summer in Bihar, India, working in a Catholic leprosy hospital. Murphy performed medical missionary work in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake.

In 2017, he introduced the STOP Act (Strengthen Opioid Misuse Prevention Act), North Carolina's first major legislative initiative to confront the opioid epidemic. Murphy then introduced the HOPE Act, which helped law enforcement curtail drug trafficking. These two initiatives, along with other interventions, were credited with reducing North Carolina's opioid overdose deaths for the first time in over a decade.
Murphy introduced legislation that helped veterans get access to hyperbaric oxygen therapy as treatment for traumatic brain injuries and post-traumatic stress disorder. After the deaths of three newborns in eastern North Carolina, he introduced legislation to improve birthing standards for birth centers in North Carolina.

== Bills and amendments introduced in congress ==


=== EDUCATE Act ===
On March 19, 2024, Greg Murphy introduced a bill to the 118th Congress that would amend the Higher Education Act of 1965. The amendment would ban graduate medical schools with diversity, equity and inclusion training and offices from receiving any federal funds.
According to his opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal, Murphy suggests that DEI training is "dangerous everywhere" and that it will lead to "future physicians less qualified to meet patients’ needs."


== Political positions ==


=== Chinese espionage ===
As a result of Chinese espionage at American universities, Murphy introduced the INFLUENCE Act, aimed at reducing the number of Chinese nationals attending American higher education institutions. While requiring higher education institutions to report gifts of $50,000 or more from a foreign source, Murphy's legislation also establishes interagency coordination on the enforcement of any violations exposing U.S. national security projects.


=== Joe Biden ===
During the 2020 presidential campaign, Murphy claimed on Twitter that Joe Biden "obviously is fighting the ravages of dementia." Questioned about the assertion by a reporter, Murphy, a urologist, said he was only echoing what the public thinks. "The majority of American people believe he does have dementia", he said.


=== Kamala Harris ===
In an October 2020 tweet that later was deleted, Murphy called Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris a "walking disaster" who "was only picked for her color and her race".


=== Controversial 9/11 tweet ===
Murphy was condemned for a tweet directed at Representative Ilhan Omar, a Muslim.
"Heartbroken to learn another CP was killed while protecting the Capitol", Omar wrote after an April 2 incident. "My thoughts and prayers go out to the officer's family and the entire Capitol Police force. The death toll would have been worse if the assailant had an AR-15 instead of a knife." Murphy responded, "Would have been worse if they had been flying planes into the buildings also".


=== Davidson College controversy ===
Murphy was among 11 co-signers of a letter criticizing his alma mater, Davidson College, for recently removing a requirement that its president and most trustees be Christian. In a May 2021 email to alumni from an official-looking address, the group said Davidson had strayed from its religious roots and "wandered into the realm of political and social activism."
In a follow-up message titled "Unauthorized Davidson Alumni Email", Davidson's alumni office said it "did not authorize the release of alumni email addresses, the use of our name or the contents of the email." It said its IT staff was investigating and "taking this matter very seriously".


=== Texas v. Pennsylvania ===
In December 2020, Murphy was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Biden defeated Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.


=== Objection during 2021 United States Electoral College vote count ===

In January 2021, Murphy was one of several Republican members of the House, led by Representative Mo Brooks of Alabama and Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, who declared that they would formally object to the counting of the electoral votes of five swing states won by Biden during the January 6 joint session. The objections would then trigger votes from both houses.
At least 140 House Republicans reportedly planned to vote against the counting of electoral votes, despite the lack of any credible allegation of an irregularity that would have affected the election, and the allegations' rejections by courts, election officials, the Electoral College, and others, and despite the fact that almost all of the Republican objectors had "just won elections in the very same balloting they are now claiming was fraudulently administered".
Murphy said in a press release the day before the joint session, "I have been quite vocal in stating that to preserve the integrity of our elections, we must fight to ensure that every voice is heard, every legal vote is counted, and every count is confirmed", adding that he believed the actions of executive officials and judges in several states were "at best troubling and at worst seditious."
After the storming of the United States Capitol by a mob of rioters supporting Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, Murphy voted to agree with the objection to Pennsylvania's results.


=== Second impeachment of Donald Trump ===
Murphy did not cast a vote on Trump's second impeachment on January 13, 2021. He released a statement that he "strongly opposed" the impeachment but he would miss the vote because he was with his wife as she recovered from a surgery.


=== Abortion and rape ===
In June 2022, Murphy tweeted and two hours later deleted a comment regarding the overturning of Roe v. Wade in the case of rape: "no one forces anyone to have sex." According to the CDC, nearly one in five women is a victim of rape or attempted rape in her lifetime, and many men are raped as well.


== Personal life ==
Murphy and his wife, Wendy, live in Greenville, North Carolina. He is Catholic.

== Early life and career ==
Foxx was born in the Bronx borough of New York City, to Dollie (née Garrison) and Nunzio John Palmieri. She was raised in a rural area of Avery County, North Carolina. Foxx grew up in a poor family and didn't live in a home with running water and electricity until age 14.
While attending Crossnore High School in Crossnore, North Carolina, Foxx worked as a janitor at the school and was the first in her family to graduate from high school. She graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a bachelor's degree in 1968 and later earned both a Master of Arts in college teaching (1972) and an Ed.D (1985) from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. Foxx and her husband owned and operated a nursery and landscaping business.
Foxx worked as a research assistant and then an English instructor at Caldwell Community College & Technical Institute and Appalachian State University before moving into university administration. From 1987 until her 1994 entry into politics, she was president of Mayland Community College. Under North Carolina Governor James G. Martin, Foxx served as Deputy Secretary for Management. From 1994 to 2004, she served in the North Carolina Senate.

=== Political campaigns ===

Foxx was first elected to the U.S. House in 2004, defeating Jim Harrell, Jr. with 59% of the vote.
Foxx was briefly targeted for defeat in the 2006 elections, but the Democrats' top choice, Winston-Salem mayor Allen Joines, decided not to run. Joines later said he lacked the stomach for the kind of race he felt it would take to defeat Foxx. Her 2006 opponent was Roger Sharpe, whom she defeated.
Roy Carter of Ashe County was Foxx's opponent in the 2008 election; she won by a substantial margin.
In 2010, Foxx was reelected with about 65% of the vote.
In 2014, Foxx was reelected with about 60% of the vote, defeating software developer Josh Brannon.
In 2016, Foxx was reelected with about 59% of the vote, again over Brannon.
In 2018, Foxx was reelected with 57% of the vote, defeating DD Adams, a council member for the North Ward of Winston-Salem.
In the 2020 general election, Foxx won over 66% of the vote, defeating Democrat David Brown.

=== Tenure ===


==== Hurricane Katrina ====
In September 2005, Foxx was one of 11 members of Congress to vote against the $51 billion aid package to victims of Hurricane Katrina.

In January 2013, Foxx co-sponsored legislation that would stop children born in the United States to undocumented parents from gaining citizenship.


==== First Trump impeachment ====
On December 18, 2019, Foxx voted against both articles of impeachment (abuse of power and obstruction of Congress) of President Donald Trump.


==== House security ====
In May 2021, Foxx became the fifth Republican representative to be fined for evading metal detectors put in place outside the chamber after the January 2021 storming of the Capitol. Foxx ran through the magnetometer, setting it off, and ignored officers attempting to prevent her entering the House floor.


==== Behavior with the news media ====
Foxx has been known for frequently scolding reporters and staff for being on or near members-only elevators in Capitol buildings. In October 2023 while among Republicans gathered for a press conference for then-House speaker nominee Mike Johnson, she was scrutinized for telling a reporter to "go away" and "shut up" when he was asked to speak about his efforts to overturn the 2020 U.S. Presidential election.


=== Committee assignments ===
House Rules Committee (Chair)
Committee on Education and Labor
Committee on Oversight and Government Reform


=== Caucus memberships ===

Congressional Constitution Caucus
Congressional Caucus on Turkey and Turkish Americans


== Political positions ==


=== Abortion ===
Foxx opposes legal access to abortion. She voted for a bill to repeal a rule requiring state and local governments to distribute federal funds to qualified health centers, even if they perform abortions. In 2014 Foxx was asked whether there were any conditions under which she considered abortion acceptable. She replied that, even in the case of rape, incest, or the health of the mother, no exception should be made to justify abortion.


=== Economy ===
In a 2007 interview, Foxx said, "We have the best economy we have had in 50 years."
Foxx, along with all other Senate and House Republicans, voted against the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.


=== Health care ===
An opponent of the Affordable Care Act, she has said, "we have more to fear from the potential of the Affordable Health Care for America Act passing than we do from any terrorist right now in any country."  When commenting on the House version of the reform bill that funds counseling for end-of-life issues, Foxx said, "Republicans have a better solution that won't put the government in charge of people's health care" and "[The plan] is pro-life because it will not put seniors in a position of being put to death by their government."


=== LGBT rights ===
In April 2009, Foxx expressed opposition to the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, claiming that Matthew Shepard's murder was not a hate crime. While debating the act in the House, she called the murder a "very unfortunate incident" but claimed "we know that that young man was killed in the commitment of a robbery. It wasn't because he was gay." She ultimately called that allegation "a hoax that continues to be used as an excuse for passing hate crimes bills". Some media outlets, including The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Huffington Post, criticized her statements, as did Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Democratic sources claimed that Matthew Shepard's mother was present during Foxx's statements.
Foxx later retracted her comments, suggesting her use of the word "hoax" was in bad taste. She suggested that Shepard's murder was a tragedy and that his killers had received appropriate justice.
In 2010, Foxx voted against the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act.
In 2015, Foxx condemned the Supreme Court decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, which held that same-sex marriage bans violated the constitution.

In December 2022, Foxx voted against the Respect for Marriage Act, which codified same-sex and interracial marriage rights into federal law.


=== Privacy rights ===
She introduced the 'Preserving Employee Wellness Programs Act' (H.R. 1313; 115th Congress) in 2017. The bill would eliminate the genetic privacy protections of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (Public Law 110–233); allow companies to require employees to undergo genetic testing or risk paying a penalty of thousands of dollars; and let employers see that genetic and other health information.


=== Texas v. Pennsylvania ===
In December 2020, Foxx was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump.


=== 2021 Electoral College vote certification ===
On January 6, 2021, Foxx was one of 147 Republican lawmakers who objected to the certification of electoral votes from the 2020 presidential election.


=== Marijuana ===
In December 2020, Foxx voted against the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act (MORE). According to financial disclosure reports, she has made at least six investments in Altria, one of the world's largest tobacco companies and a leader in the burgeoning U.S. cannabis industry, since September 2020. In all, records show she has purchased somewhere between $79,000 and $210,000 in Altria stock.

== Early life and career ==
McDowell was born in January 1994. He was raised in Lexington, North Carolina, and graduated from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte in 2016. He worked for a United States House of Representatives election campaign for Richard Hudson and in constituent services for Representative Ted Budd. He then served as a lobbyist for Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina.


== Political career ==
McDowell decided to run for the United States House of Representatives in North Carolina's 6th congressional district in the 2024 elections. He attributed his decision to run to his younger brother Luke's death from an accidental fentanyl overdose.
McDowell finished in first place in the Republican primary election with 26% of the vote, though he fell short of the 30% of the vote required to avoid a runoff election. Mark Walker finished in second place, with 24%. Though Walker initially indicated that he wanted a runoff election, he opted to join the Donald Trump 2024 presidential campaign rather than seek a runoff, making McDowell the Republican nominee. He won the November election.


== Personal life ==
McDowell's younger brother, Luke, died from an overdose of fentanyl in 2016. He has two children.

Mark Everette Harris (born April 24, 1966) is an American pastor and politician from North Carolina. A member of the Republican Party, he is the U.S. representative for North Carolina's 8th congressional district since 2025.
Harris first ran for the United States Senate in 2014, placing third in the Republican primary. He then ran to represent North Carolina's 9th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives in the 2016 election, but he was defeated in the Republican primary by incumbent Robert Pittenger.
Harris ran for the 9th district again in 2018, narrowly defeating Pittenger in the Republican primary. In the general election against Democratic opponent Dan McCready, initial tallies appeared to show Harris winning the election, but an election panel declined to certify these results following allegations of ballot fraud involving McCrae Dowless, a Republican political operative employed by the Harris campaign. Dowless was later criminally charged in connection with the alleged fraud, but Harris was not charged. In February 2019, the bipartisan North Carolina Board of Elections dismissed the results of the election and called for a new election to be held. Harris was not a candidate in the new election, which was won by fellow Republican Dan Bishop.
Harris then announced his bid for the 8th district in 2024, following Bishop's decision to retire and instead run for Attorney General. After defeating five opponents to win the Republican nomination, Harris went on to win the general election in what was described by multiple outlets as a comeback bid.


== Early life and career ==
Harris was born in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, on April 24, 1966. He attended local schools there before earning his bachelor's degree in political science from Appalachian State University. He earned both a Master of Divinity (M.Div.) and Doctor of Ministry (D.Min.) from Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary.
Harris is the lead pastor at Trinity Baptist Church in Mooresville, North Carolina. He has served as the senior pastor of the First Baptist Church in Charlotte, North Carolina, and as president of the Baptist State Convention of North Carolina. He served as senior of Augusta, Georgia's Curtis Baptist Church from January 1, 2000 to July 2005. He began preaching at Mooresville, North Carolina's Trinity Baptist Church in February 2020.


== Political career ==
Harris ran for the United States Senate in the 2014 election, finishing in third place in the Republican primary behind Thom Tillis and Greg Brannon. He later ran against incumbent congressman Robert Pittenger for North Carolina's 9th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives in the 2016 election. The election went to a recount, with Pittenger certified the winner by 134 votes.


=== 2018 congressional campaign ===
Harris resigned from the First Baptist Church in 2017 and ran again for the U.S. House in 2018. This time, Harris defeated Pittenger in the Republican primary (which featured a higher turnout than the 2016 primary).
After the November 6, 2018 general election, Harris was 905 votes ahead of his Democratic competitor, Dan McCready, after county election boards certified the election; however, the North Carolina Board of Elections voted 9–0 on November 27 to delay the election to investigate fraud allegations. Following an investigation, the Board ordered that a new election be held. Harris was not a candidate in the new election.


==== Election fraud allegations ====

Following the November 6, 2018, midterm elections in North Carolina's 9th congressional district, initial tallies put Harris 905 votes ahead of his Democratic competitor, Dan McCready. McCready conceded on the day after the election; however, the state Democratic Party filed affidavits claiming that the Harris campaign had engaged in ballot fraud. The North Carolina Board of Elections voted 9–0 on November 27 not to certify the election.
The Board of Elections later opened an investigation into the activities of Leslie McCrae Dowless, a Harris campaign operative who had prior felony convictions for perjury and fraud. According to The Washington Post, Harris directed the hiring of Dowless for his campaign even though Harris received personal warnings in 2016 that Dowless had almost certainly used questionable tactics when working for a previous campaign.
In January 2019, Harris filed a petition to have a court certify him as the winner of the election; Harris's petition was rejected that same month. That same month, Harris said "no evidence has been supplied that suggests the outcome of the race is in question"; The News & Observer disputed Harris's assertion, stating that it was "extremely unlikely" that Harris knew "the extent of evidence that has been submitted to the NC elections board". On February 9, 2019, Harris said that "Democrats and liberal media have spared no expense disparaging" his good name and blamed "a liberal activist" on the Board of Elections for controversy surrounding the election. He described the alleged ballot-harvesting scheme as "unsubstantiated slandering". During the investigation, the North Carolina Republican Party declared, "Mark Harris won the election", calling on the state elections board to certify Harris as the winner. The party also defended Harris, describing him as an "innocent victim".
The North Carolina State Board of Elections held hearings from February 18 to February 21, 2019 to further investigate the disputed election results. During those hearings, election officials accused the Harris campaign of withholding incriminating documents. Lisa Britt, the daughter of Dowless's ex-wife, testified that under Dowless's direction, absentee ballots had been unlawfully collected from voters. Britt added that in some cases, Dowless's associates had filled in blank ballot votes to favor Republican candidates and had falsified witness signatures. Bladen County, where Dowless had operated, was the only county in which Harris had prevailed over McCready in the absentee ballot results. Harris's son, who is a federal prosecutor, told the board that he had repeatedly warned his father about Dowless and that Dowless might be involved in illegal activities. Harris told the board that Dowless had assured him that his operation was legal.
The New York Times wrote that Harris "appeared to mislead" the board with some of his testimony. Harris later acknowledged that some of his testimony had been inaccurate, blaming his health problems as an explanation for his erroneous testimony. He then said that "It's become clear to me the public's confidence in the 9th District seat general election has been undermined to an extent that a new election is warranted." Harris's attorney David Freedman also said "we agree that the actions that occurred in Bladen County likely affected the election."
On February 21, the Board of Elections unanimously voted to order that a new election be held in the congressional race. The Board also ordered new elections in two other contests for local offices. On February 26, 2019, citing ill health, Harris declared that he would not compete in the new election.


==== Aftermath ====
On February 27, 2019, Dowless was arrested after being indicted by a Wake County grand jury. He was charged with multiple counts related to illegal ballot handling and obstructing justice in the 2016 and 2018 elections. An additional four people who worked for him were also charged. In July, additional charges of perjury and solicitation to commit perjury were added in a superseding indictment.
Dowless died in 2022. The legal charges against him were formally dropped by prosecutors upon his death.


=== 2024 congressional campaign ===

In September 2023, Harris announced that he would run for the House of Representatatives in North Carolina's 8th district, as incumbent Dan Bishop chose to run for attorney general of North Carolina. Harris won the nomination on March 5 against five other opponents, garnering just over 30% of the vote and thus avoiding a runoff against runner-up Allan Baucom. Harris won the November election, defeating Democratic nominee Justin Dues by around 19 points.


=== Political positions ===


==== Education ====
In 2014, Harris called for abolishing the U.S. Department of Education.


==== Federal budget ====
Harris has stated that he would support a Balanced Budget Amendment and cited concern over what was at the time $19 trillion in debt and $120 trillion in unfunded liabilities.
In 2014, Harris supported reforming Social Security, including reducing the future Social Security payments for those who were currently less than 50 years old.


==== Religion ====
Harris has described Islam as "dangerous" and the work of Satan. In 2014, he claimed that Islam was taking over the world, including the United States. According to Media Matters, Harris signed a statement which declared that "terrorist entities are not aberrations of Islam, they are the very essence of it."
In 2011, Harris said in a sermon at First Baptist Charlotte that there would never be peace between Jews and Muslims unless they convert to Christianity.
During the 2018 campaign, American Bridge 21st Century, a Democratic super PAC that conducts opposition research, brought attention to a 2013 sermon that Harris had given where he questioned whether it was the "healthiest pursuit" for women to prioritize their careers and independence over their biblical "core calling".
Harris is a believer in Young Earth creationism.


==== Social issues ====
Harris opposed the Supreme Court's ruling in Roe v. Wade which prohibited bans on abortion. He has stated that the Affordable Care Act has made healthcare more costly for businesses.
Harris has called upon wives to be submissive to their husbands and has said he believes homosexuality is a choice. At a rally in 2015, Harris criticized "moral decay" in the United States, saying "We have watched in one generation where homosexuality was once criminalized to now we see the criminalization of Christianity." Harris led supporters of North Carolina Amendment 1, which banned same-sex marriage in North Carolina in 2012. The amendment was found to be unconstitutional by a federal court in 2014, and prohibitions on same-sex marriage were found to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court's Obergefell v. Hodges decision in 2015. After the Supreme Court ruling, Harris said, "one of the most devastating blows to the American way of life has been the breakdown of the family unit. A marriage consists of one man and one woman. The Supreme Court, in a 5–4 decision, decided otherwise."
Harris campaigned for the Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act (commonly known as the "bathroom bill") in North Carolina in 2016, which stated that in government buildings, individuals (such as students at state-operated schools) may only use restrooms and changing facilities that correspond to the sex identified on their birth certificate. The bill sparked a widespread backlash and boycott, including by major U.S. firms. Amid the backlash, Harris adamantly argued against repealing the bill. The bill was eventually repealed and replaced with House Bill 142 on March 30, 2017.
Prior to his election to congress, Harris organized a church grassroots operation on behalf of the social conservative evangelical Family Research Council. Harris has promoted Family Research Council material that endorsed conversion therapy for gays and lesbians.

== Personal life ==
Harris and his wife Beth have three children and six grandchildren.
In January 2019, Harris was reported to have falsely set off a fire alarm, allegedly to avoid news media. Harris explained his actions by stating that he was rushing to catch a sports game.

Timothy Keith Moore (born October 2, 1970) is an American attorney and politician who has been the U.S. representative for North Carolina's 14th congressional district since 2025. He previously served as speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives from 2015 to 2025. A Republican, Moore represented the 111th State House District, which includes Cleveland County. Moore was first elected to the state House in 2002.


== Early life and education ==
Moore was born on October 2, 1970, in Kings Mountain, North Carolina, in the western part of the state. He attended Kings Mountain High School, and as a teenager, Moore worked at the state General Assembly as a page, later interning for a state senator.
Moore first attended Campbell College, where he joined the College Republicans. After two years he transferred to University of North Carolina, where he completed a B.A. in 1992. He was active in the student government at both colleges. He took a fight to the UNC student Supreme Court in an effort to add more members to the Student Congress. In 1995, Moore graduated with a from the Oklahoma City University School of Law.


== Legal and business career ==
In 1995, Moore joined a law firm in the Cleveland County town of Shelby. He opened his own law practice in Kings Mountain in 2009, representing business and individual clients.
In 2015, Moore was hired by the Cleveland County Commission as an attorney for the county, serving in this role simultaneously with his position as speaker of the state House.
Moore co-owns 67 Motors, a Forsyth County metal recycling business.


== Early political career ==
When Moore was 26, he was elected chair of the Cleveland County Republican Party in 1997. That same year, he was also appointed to the UNC Board of Governors; he was the youngest person to be appointed to that position.


== North Carolina House of Representatives ==
Moore was first elected to the North Carolina House of Representatives in 2002, after defeating the incumbent House Majority Whip, Democratic Representative Andy Dedmon. A staunch conservative Republican, Moore spent his first four terms in office in the minority party, as Democrats then controlled the House. In 2010, the Republicans won control of the House, and Speaker Thom Tillis appointed Moore to the powerful post of chairman of the Rules Committee, where he became known for abruptly cutting off many floor debates.
As part of the Republican leadership team in the House, Moore helped pass "sweeping legislation to lower taxes on business, tighten rules on abortion and voting, and decline to extend Medicaid coverage to 500,000 uninsured North Carolinians." Moore opposes same-sex marriage, supported a state constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage in 2012, and joined legal efforts to defend the ban. However, in 2017, when a group of the state House's most conservative Republicans proposed legislation that would declare "null and void" the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Obergefell v. Hodges (2015) (which held that there is a constitutional right to same-sex marriage), Moore blocked the bill from advancing in the state House.
In 2014 Moore was one of the state House's biggest campaign fundraisers. His skill at fundraising for the Republican Party contributed to his election as speaker of the North Carolina House in 2015.
Moore and State Senator Harry Brown were the top two North Carolina lawmakers to gain substantial earmarked funding for their districts in the 2015 state budget, securing a collective total of $19 million. Moore defended his use of earmarks for projects in his district.


=== Speaker of the House ===

Moore was a sponsor in 2016 of House Bill 2, a controversial "bathroom bill" barring transgender individuals from using bathrooms that conform to their gender identity. After the U.S. Department of Justice said that the legislation violated federal anti-discrimination law and demanded that the state cease implementation, Moore rejected the DOJ's position and accused the Obama administration of "bullying", saying, "The deadline will come and go. We will take no action."
Moore has opposed curbs on gerrymandering in North Carolina. In a legal suit against partisan gerrymandering in the state, Moore and his state Senate counterpart (Republican Phil Berger) urged the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn a lower court's ruling that the partisan gerrymandering of North Carolina's congressional districts was unconstitutional.
In 2018, Moore won a third term as speaker of the House.
In 2018, following a mass shooting at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, Moore established a North Carolina House Select Committee on School Safety. Moore rejected Democratic proposals to discuss changes to gun laws, and the committee never took up gun control proposals. Moore instead proposed the use of volunteer officers to guard schools.
In 2019, a controversy took place after emails came to light, showing that in 2016, a high-ranking aide to Moore had corresponded with the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) about a Siler City chicken processing plant co-owned by Moore that was being offered for sale. At the aide's request, DEQ approved the plant's participation in a state subsidy program that provided $22,000 for the repair of a leaking underground storage tank at the factory, which may have aided in the sale of the plant. The revelation prompted the Campaign for Accountability to file a complaint with the North Carolina State Ethics Commission. Moore denied knowledge of the emails. A previous complaint against Moore regarding the Siler City chicken plant was dismissed in 2018. The North Carolina State Board of Elections and Ethics reviewed the complaint and information resulting from the staff's investigation. The investigating panel from the State Elections and Ethics Board unanimously voted to dismiss the complaint upon conclusion of their inquiry.
In 2019, Democratic Governor Roy Cooper vetoed the state budget. On the morning of September 11, 2019, during a calendared legislative session Moore called a vote to override the veto of the state budget. The override passed on a vote of 55–9. Nearly half of members were absent during the vote, most of the absent members were Democrats. Democrats in the state House were greatly angered by the Republicans' move, saying that Moore and other House Republican leaders had made assurances that no votes would be called during the morning session. Moore defended the vote and said that he had made no pledges that no vote would take place.
In 2021, a new 14th congressional district was created that included Moore's home of Cleveland County. While Moore was expected to run for the seat, he said he would not after Madison Cawthorn announced his candidacy. Moore said he would run for another House term.


== U.S. Congressional Campaign ==
Tim Moore announced his Candidacy for Congress in late 2023 to represent the newly-drawn NC-14. Tim Moore won his race against Democrat Pam Genant, becoming Representative-Elect for NC-14. Moore was sworn in on January 3rd, 2025.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==
Tim Moore was sworn in on January 3, 2025. Moore succeeded Jeff Jackson, who did not seek reelection and instead ran successfully for North Carolina Attorney General after the redrawing made his district significantly more Republican leaning.


== Controversies ==
While a member of the North Carolina House of Representatives, Moore directed state funding toward projects in his home county of Cleveland. In 2016, Cleveland County received a $1.5 million grant-funded water and sewer upgrades for an area where several individuals with close connections to Moore's campaign resided. In 2018, the county received $500,000 in the state budget to host the American Legion Baseball World Series, which it had hosted since 2011 with no state funds.
In 2012, Moore's private law practice in Kings Mountain received a $62,000 development grant, during a year which was noted for steep state budget cuts. Moore was advised by a member of the state's ethics commission to avoid conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest after this.
In 2015, an article written by a local journalist prompted an FBI inquiry into Moore's campaign reports. The FBI declined to comment on the inquiry, and there were never any charges filed regarding the allegations of wrongdoing.
In 2019, Moore's legislative aides engaged with the state Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) in regards to a property Moore owned. Moore and his business partners sold that property to Mountaire Farms, an Arkansas-based poultry conglomerate that is a donor to North Carolina Republicans, for a 650% profit. 
In 2022, Holly Grange, a former state representative and member of the UNC-Wilmington Board of Trustees, alleged that she was removed from the board because Moore was upset she did not support his preferred candidate for the next Chancellor of UNC-Wilmington. 
In June 2023, a suit was brought by Scott Lassiter, a Wake Soil and Water Conservation District and former Apex Town Council member, alleging that Moore had enticed Lassiter's wife into an affair. Moore said the lawsuit was baseless. The suit was resolved in July 2023.


== Personal life ==
Moore has two sons. He is a member of First Baptist Church of Kings Mountain, which is a member of the Southern Baptist Convention.

Julie Ann Fedorchak (née Liffrig; born September 28, 1968) is an American politician who is the U.S. representative for North Dakota's at-large congressional district and the first woman elected to the House of Representatives from North Dakota. She previously served as a member of the North Dakota Public Service Commission. She was appointed to the commission by Governor Jack Dalrymple in December 2012 and easily won reelection to that position three times: to a two-year term in 2014, to a six-year term in 2016, and to another six-year term in 2022.


== Background ==
Fedorchak was born in Williston, North Dakota in 1968. She is the youngest of 8 to parents Duane and Doris Liffrig. Duane previously served as Highway Commissioner to former Governor of North Dakota Allen Olson.
Fedorchak graduated from the University of North Dakota with a Bachelor of Arts in Journalism. She later served as communications director for Governor Ed Schafer before becoming a columnist for the Bismarck Tribune and doing numerous other media work.
Fedorchak has also served on numerous boards.


== Public Service Commission ==
In December 2012, Governor Jack Dalrymple appointed Fedorchak to the North Dakota Public Service Commission after a seat opened. She later won an election to hold the seat in 2014. Shortly after being fully elected to the commission, Fedorchak was also swiftly elected to chair the commission for a two-year term.
Fedorchak was later re-elected in 2016 and in 2022 by wide margins.
Fedorchak has overseen and assisted the commission in numerous projects and investments while also offering transparent information.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== 2024 election ===
In February 2024, Fedorchak announced her entry into the race for North Dakota's open U.S. House seat. Fedorchak cited matters such as abortion, energy, and agriculture as issues she would focus on as a representative.
Her main primary opponents were former state Representative Rick Becker, farmer Alex Balazs, activist Sharlet Mohr, and Miss America 2018 Cara Mund for the Republican nomination. During the NDGOP endorsement convention, candidate Rick Becker encouraged his supporters to write in spoiler ballots to prevent an endorsement from going through. After 2 failed ballots, Fedorchak withdrew from the endorsement to allow the convention to continue, giving Alex Balazs the endorsment.
Fedorchak received the most state level endorsements of any candidate in the race, including over 50 legislators, U.S. Senator John Hoeven, Governor Doug Burgum, and former President Donald Trump.
In the June 11 primary, Fedorchak won the Republican nomination with 46% of the vote. She would face Democrat Trygve Hammer in the general election. Shortly after the primary, Fedorchak's campaign filed an FEC complaint regarding election interference after a mass of texts and emails were sent falsely stating she had dropped out of the race on the day of the election.
Fedorchak defeated Hammer in the election 69% to 30%, making her the first woman to be elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from North Dakota. She is also the first Republican woman elected to Congress from North Dakota and the first woman to represent North Dakota in Congress since Heidi Heitkamp, who served in the U.S. Senate from 2013 to 2019.


=== Tenure ===
Fedorchak was sworn in on January 3, 2025. She was chosen in her first term to serve on the Energy and Commerce committee, where her predecessor had served as the Vice-Chair. Fedorchak is also the first freshman member in 14 years to be appointed to the committee.


== Personal life ==
Fedorchak has had 3 children with her husband, Michael Fedorchak. She enjoys being active, reading, and traveling in her free time. They have been members of the Cathedral of the Holy Spirit congregation in Bismarck for 30 years.

James Daniel Jordan (born February 17, 1964) is an American politician currently serving in his ninth term in the U.S. House of Representatives as the representative for Ohio's 4th congressional district since 2007. He is a member of the Republican Party.
Jordan is a two-time NCAA national champion wrestler and a former college wrestling coach. In Congress, Jordan helped start the right-wing populist House Freedom Caucus, serving as its first chair from 2015 to 2017, and as its vice chair since 2017. Jordan was a prominent critic of Speaker of the House John Boehner, who resigned under Freedom Caucus pressure in 2015. He was the ranking member of the House Oversight Committee from 2019 to 2020, when he left to become the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, of which he became chair in 2023.
Jordan is a close ally of President Donald Trump. During Trump's first presidency, Jordan sought to discredit investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election and staged a sit-in to prevent a Trump impeachment inquiry hearing over the Trump–Zelenskyy telephone controversy. After Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election and Trump tried to overturn the election, Jordan supported lawsuits to challenge the election results and voted not to certify the Electoral College results. He refused to cooperate with the U.S. House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack, which subpoenaed him on May 12, 2022.
Jordan, who opposed Kevin McCarthy during his failed bid to succeed Boehner as speaker in 2015, later became one of McCarthy's closest allies; Jordan supported McCarthy during the January 2023 Speaker of the House election. After McCarthy was removed as speaker, Jordan stood in the October 2023 election to replace him. He became the second nominee of the House Republican Conference after Steve Scalise withdrew, but failed to win the speakership in three rounds of voting and had his nomination revoked.


== Early life and education ==
Jordan was born in Troy, Ohio, the son of Shirley and John Jordan, and raised in Champaign County, Ohio. He attended and wrestled for Graham High School, graduating in 1982. He won state championships all four years he was in high school and compiled a 156–1 win–loss record.
After high school, Jordan went to the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where he became a two-time NCAA Division I wrestling champion. Jordan won the 1985 and 1986 NCAA championship matches in the 134-pound (61 kg) weight class, defeating future multi time World and Olympic champion John Smith in the former. He lost the 126–137-pound (57–62 kg) featherweight semifinal match at the 1988 US Olympic wrestling trials against Smith, failing to qualify for the Olympic team in freestyle wrestling. Jordan graduated from Wisconsin in 1986 with a bachelor's degree in economics. 
Jordan later earned a master's degree in education from Ohio State University and received a Juris Doctor degree from the Capital University Law School in 2001. In a 2018 interview, Jordan said he never took the bar examination.


== Early career ==


=== Ohio State wrestling assistant coach during team's abuse scandal ===

Jordan was an assistant coach with Ohio State University's wrestling program from 1987 to 1995.
Richard Strauss was the wrestling team physician during Jordan's tenure. Strauss died by suicide in 2005. In April 2018, Ohio State University began an independent investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct by Strauss. The report concluded that Strauss had committed sexual abuse against 177 student-patients.: 37–38  The majority of abuse (143 victims) was categorized as genital fondling associated with medically unnecessary genital or rectal examinations.: 41  Of the 177, 153 were student-athletes, of which a plurality (48) were members of the men's wrestling team.: 43 
Several involved persons have stated that Jordan surely knew of Strauss's criminal misconduct but did not report it. Other wrestlers and Head Coach Russ Hellickson said he may not have known about the abuse. A spokesperson for Jordan denied the allegation, saying that "chairman Jordan never saw or heard of any abuse, and if he had, he would have dealt with it". No wrestlers have accused Jordan himself of sexual misconduct, but four former wrestlers named him as a defendant in a lawsuit against the university. Jordan has denied any wrongdoing and has described his accusers as "pawns in a political plot".


=== Ohio General Assembly ===

Jordan was elected to the Ohio House of Representatives in November 1994 and represented the 85th Ohio House district for three terms.
In 2000, Jordan was elected to the Ohio Senate over independent candidate Jack Kaffenberger with 88% of the vote. In 2004, Jordan defeated Kaffenberger again, with 79% of the vote.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===
Jordan represents Ohio's 4th congressional district, a primarily urban district, which includes Lima, Mansfield, Marysville, and Marion, and parts of Columbus.
Jordan first ran for Congress in 2006, where he won the Republican primary for the 4th district after 26-year incumbent Mike Oxley announced his retirement. Jordan defeated Democratic nominee Rick Siferd in the general election with 60% of the vote.
Jordan was reelected in 2008, defeating Democratic nominee Mike Carroll with 65% of the vote. In 2010, he was again reelected, defeating Democrat Doug Litt and Libertarian Donald Kissick with 71% of the vote. Jordan was reelected in 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018, 2020, 2022, and 2024.


=== Tenure ===
Jordan chaired the Republican Study Committee during the 112th Congress, while turning down a position on the Appropriations Committee. During the 2013 US government shutdown, he was described by Rolling Stone as the committee's most powerful member. That group was the primary proponent and executor of the Republican congressional strategy to bring about a government shutdown in order to force changes in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.
Jordan received a vote for Speaker of the United States House of Representatives in the 113th Congress from a fellow right-wing conservative, Tea Party Caucus chairman Tim Huelskamp. Jordan received two votes for Speaker during the 114th Congress. On July 26, 2018, he announced his bid for Speaker after Paul Ryan retired; his campaign ended when Democrats took the majority in the House. Subsequently, Jordan campaigned for House minority leader. Former Ohio state representative Capri Cafaro said that Jordan "is someone who has built a reputation as an attack dog, someone who is media savvy, someone who is a stalwart supporter of the president and who has the skill necessary to take the lead for the GOP". He lost his bid to Kevin McCarthy in a 159–43 vote. In 2023, Jordan returned to consideration for the speakership after McCarthy failed to win it after three rounds of voting.
Jordan was the ranking member of the House Oversight Committee from January 2019 to June 2020, with a brief interlude in March 2020. He was replaced by James Comer.
Jordan's district has been redrawn over time to minimize urban area (such as Toledo, Columbus or Cleveland) and increase rural area; it now stretches from Lake Erie nearly to Dayton. In May 2019, a three-judge federal panel ruled Ohio's congressional district map unconstitutional due to partisan gerrymandering and ordered Ohio to create a new map in time for the 2020 election. But after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Rucho v. Common Cause that courts could not review allegations of gerrymandering, the district boundaries were not to change until maps were redrawn in 2022.
In December 2021, the House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack released the partial contents of a text message an unnamed lawmaker sent to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows before the scheduled final certification of presidential electors on January 6, 2021. The excerpt read: "On January 6, 2021, Vice President Mike Pence, as President of the Senate, should call out all the electoral votes that he believes are unconstitutional as no electoral votes at all." The day after the release, Jordan acknowledged sending the message, but said he had merely forwarded it after receiving it from attorney Joseph Schmitz. Both Jordan and Meadows asserted that the committee had altered the context of the excerpt by misplacing a period.

As chair of the Judicial committee, Jordan received on 26 August 2024 a letter from Mark Zuckerberg in which the Facebook founder and Instagram magnate expressed regret at his firm's election interference in the 2020 US Presidential election. In the same letter he expressed regret over his "covid misinformation" actions. Zuckerberg wrote that the Biden White House "pressured" Meta to "censor" content. Jordan's fellow  Republicans said the letter was a "big win for free speech".


==== Freedom Caucus ====
During the 114th Congress, Jordan and eight other members of Congress founded the House Freedom Caucus, a bloc of conservatives working "to advance an agenda of limited constitutional government" in Congress. He served as the group's first chair. The caucus was ultimately credited with pushing Speaker John Boehner into retirement.


==== Legislation ====

As of 2023, Jordan, who has served in the House of Representatives for over 16 years, has never sponsored a bill that later became law.
On May 2, 2014, Jordan introduced House Resolution 565, "Calling on Attorney General Eric H. Holder, Jr., to appoint a special counsel to investigate the targeting of conservative nonprofit groups by the Internal Revenue Service". It passed on May 7, 2014. Holder, who had previously been found to be in contempt of Congress, failed to appoint a special counsel to investigate the alleged procedural abuses of IRS employees, including Lois Lerner.
In March 2017, Jordan criticized the newly introduced American Health Care Act, the Republican replacement bill for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, calling it an unacceptable form of "Obamacare Lite". On May 4, 2017, he voted to pass a revised version of the legislation.

On June 13, 2018, Jordan and Representative Mark Meadows filed a resolution to compel the Department of Justice to provide certain documents to Congress relating to the ongoing congressional investigations of Russian interference in the 2016 election. The resolution asserted that the DOJ was stonewalling congressional oversight and sought to give the DOJ seven days from its enactment to turn over documents related to both Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller as well as various decisions made by the FBI during the 2016 presidential election. Jordan issued a press release that stated: This resolution gives the DOJ seven days to turn over the documents that they owe Congress. Rod Rosenstein threatened congressional staff. When the bully picks on your little brother, you have to respond. It's time for House Leadership to stand up and pass this resolution.
On July 25, 2018, Jordan and Meadows introduced articles of impeachment against Rosenstein, whom they accused of "intentionally withholding embarrassing documents and information, knowingly hiding material investigative information from Congress, various abuses of the FISA process, and failure to comply with congressional subpoenas". Jordan stated that impeachment was necessary because: The DOJ is keeping information from Congress. Enough is enough. It's time to hold Mr. Rosenstein accountable for blocking Congress's constitutional oversight role.
Jordan and Representative Warren Davidson were the only members of Ohio's congressional delegation and two of 60 members of Congress to vote in October 2019 against a bipartisan resolution that passed the House 354–60 condemning Trump's unilateral withdrawal of U.S. military forces from Syria.


==== Speaker elections ====
Despite his support for Kevin McCarthy in the 2023 Speaker of the House of Representatives election, including nominating McCarthy on the second ballot, Jordan was nominated on the second ballot by Representative Matt Gaetz. He received 19 votes, enough to deny McCarthy the speakership in the second round. Jordan was nominated again on the third ballot by Chip Roy. He won 20 votes in the third ballot, with Byron Donalds switching from McCarthy to Jordan. This was enough to necessitate a fourth ballot, but Jordan got no votes on ballots 4 through 11, as all his supporters switched to Donalds. On the 12th ballot, Gaetz nominated Jordan again. He received four votes, enough to necessitate a 13th ballot when combined with the three for Kevin Hern. He was not nominated on the 13th or 14th ballot, but received six and two votes on each, respectively.
After the House removed McCarthy from the speakership on October 3, 2023, Jordan launched a bid for the speakership. His speakership bid was endorsed by Donald Trump. On October 11, Jordan was defeated by Steve Scalise for the Republican nomination for the speakership. However, after Scalise withdrew a day later after failing to consolidate the necessary votes, Jordan launched a second bid for the speakership and defeated Austin Scott for the Republican nomination. Jordan subsequently failed to win the speakership in the first two rounds of the House vote, garnering only 200 of the 217 votes needed to win in the first vote and only 199 votes in the second. A third round of voting occurred on October 20, 2023, where he garnered only 194 votes of the 217 votes needed to win in the third round. Following his third defeat, Jordan intended to continue his bid for the speakership however he was subsequently removed from his position as Speaker-designate by his Republican colleagues in a secret ballot.

== Political positions ==

According to The Dayton Daily News, Jordan "is known for being one of Congress' most conservative members".
Jordan has earned a perfect score from the American Conservative Union. He has voted consistently for anti-abortion legislation and was endorsed by Ohio Right to Life in 2012. During the 112th Congress, he was one of 40 "staunch" members of the Republican Study Committee who frequently voted against Republican party leadership and vocally expressed displeasure with House bills.
Jordan was a leading critic of President Barack Obama's Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) program, advocating for its shutdown.
Jordan has supported the continued production and upgrades of M1 Abrams tanks in his district.
Jordan, along with all other Senate and House Republicans, voted against the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.


=== Donald Trump ===
Jordan has been a stalwart supporter and close ally of Trump. Asked by Anderson Cooper in April 2018 whether he had ever heard Trump tell a lie, Jordan said "I have not" and "nothing comes to mind". He also said, "I don't know that [Trump has ever] said something wrong that he needs to apologize for."
In December 2017, Jordan sought to discredit the FBI and Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. He questioned Mueller's impartiality, and called on Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein to use his authority to disband Mueller's investigation or create a second special counsel to simultaneously investigate Mueller himself. Rosenstein rejected the request, saying that he could not appoint another special counsel as there was no credible allegation of a potential crime. The New York Times reported that Republicans were increasingly criticizing Mueller's investigation after it "delivered a series of indictments to high-profile associates of the president and evidence that at least two of them are cooperating with the inquiry".
In July 2018, Jordan led efforts to impeach Rosenstein as a way to shut down Mueller's investigation. During a hearing on July 12, 2018, Jordan repeatedly interrupted FBI agent Peter Strzok while Strzok tried to explain that he couldn't answer specific questions to preserve the confidentiality of an ongoing investigation. Democrats protested Jordan's behavior and urged their fellow representatives to allow Strzok to respond. They also objected to Jordan's exceeding his allowed time for questioning. House Judiciary Committee chairman Bob Goodlatte admonished Jordan for his repeated interruptions of the witness.
In July 2018, Jordan and Mark Meadows called on the Department of Justice to "review allegations that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein threatened to subpoena phone records and documents from a House Intelligence Committee staffer". In their written request, the two wrote that in his use of investigative powers, Rosenstein had retaliated "against rank-and-file (congressional) staff members", thereby abusing his authority. To John Catsimatidis on WNYM, Jordan said he would force a vote on Rosenstein's impeachment if the DOJ did not deliver documents Congress requested.
In March 2019, House Judiciary chair Jerrold Nadler criticized Jordan for allegedly using anti-Semitic messaging by spelling the name of the 2020 presidential candidate Tom Steyer, whose father is Jewish, with a "$" in place of an "S" on Twitter, while urging Nadler to resist calls for Trump's impeachment.
During Mueller's testimony to two congressional committees on July 24, 2019, Jordan asked Mueller why he never charged Joseph Mifsud with lying to the FBI while George Papadopoulos was charged for lying about Mifsud. Jordan said: "Mifsud is the guy who told Papadopoulos [about Russian dirt]. He was the guy who started it all. Yet when the FBI interviews him, he lies three times; you don't charge him." Mueller responded, "Well, I can't get into it and it's obvious, I think, that we can't get into charging decisions."
On October 23, 2019, Jordan and two dozen other Republicans staged a protest that delayed a Trump impeachment inquiry hearing. The coordinated action disrupted the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence where Republican and Democratic congressional members planned to take testimony from Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper. The group staged a sit-in outside the Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) hearing room. Some of the Republicans who participated already had access to the hearings since the members of the House Oversight, Intelligence and Foreign Affairs committees were welcome to attend and ask questions.
Describing the sit-in, Jordan said, "The members have just had it, and they want to be able to see and represent their constituents and find out what's going on." The next day, he said on Fox News, "Adam Schiff is doing this unfair, partisan process in secret and our members finally said, 'Enough'... We're so frustrated. They reached a boiling point and these guys marched in and said 'we want to know what's going on.'"
House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson wrote to the House sergeant-at-arms about Jordan, Representative Bradley Byrne, and others, requesting that he take action regarding their "unprecedented breach of security". Senator Lindsey Graham admonished his House colleagues for their tactic, calling them "nuts" for having made a "run on the SCIF".
As the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, during a July 2020 hearing with Attorney General Bill Barr, Jordan presented a video montage that, according to CNN host Jake Tapper, took statements by CNN reporters out of context to create the impression they were characterizing violent protests as "mostly peaceful".
In December 2020, Jordan was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a statement that called signing the amicus brief an act of "election subversion" and an attempt to "subvert the Constitution and undermine public trust in our sacred democratic institutions." New Jersey Representative Bill Pascrell, citing section three of the 14th Amendment, called for Pelosi to not seat Jordan and other amicus brief signers, arguing that they had tried to "overturn a democratic election and install a dictator", while "the 14th Amendment expressly forbids Members of Congress from engaging in rebellion against the United States".
When the Supreme Court in October 2020 permitted counting Pennsylvania mail-in ballots collected three days after the 2020 election, Jordan declared: "Democrats are trying to steal the election, after the election." In December 2020, Jordan said: "I don't know how you can ever convince me that President Trump didn't actually win this" 2020 election. On January 5, 2021, Jordan alleged: "There was fraud on top of the unconstitutional way they ran the election [with pandemic voting laws] … they added fraud on top of it … And that's why President Trump wasn't elected president". On January 12, 2021, Jordan claimed: "I've never said that this election was stolen".
On January 6–7, 2021, Jordan cast a vote to prevent the certification of the Electoral College in at least one state. He was one of the 139 representatives who voted to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in Congress on January 7, 2021, the day after the storming of the Capitol. At a later virtual committee meeting, Jordan said the storming of the Capitol "was as wrong as wrong can be".
On January 11, 2021, Trump awarded Jordan the Presidential Medal of Freedom in a closed-door ceremony.
Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows, testified before the House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack that Jordan had talked to the White House about presidential pardons for Republican members of Congress who participated in attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election.


=== Antitrust and tech policy ===
Jordan has critiqued "Big Tech" companies, though he opposes proposals to break up these companies through antitrust enforcement.
Google has contributed money to his political campaign since 2012, including $10,000 in 2020. Tucker Carlson criticized Jordan for accepting donations from Google.
In 2023, Jordan refused to make Ken Buck the chairman of the Subcommittee on Antitrust, despite Buck being the most senior Republican on the committee and a proponent of antitrust enforcement. Conservatives criticized Jordan for this decision.


=== Disinformation research ===
As chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Jordan is heading a legal campaign against researchers at universities, think tanks and private companies that study disinformation. Those affected include the Stanford Internet Observatory at Stanford University, the University of Washington, the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab and the social media analytics firm Graphika.
Since January 2023, when Republicans gained a majority in the House, the House Judiciary Committee has sent letters, subpoenas, and threats of legal action to researchers, demanding notes, emails and other records from researchers and even student interns, dating back to 2015.
Projects affected include the Election Integrity Partnership, formed to identify attempts "to suppress voting, reduce participation, confuse voters or delegitimize election results without evidence" and the Virality Project, which has examined the spread of false claims about vaccines. Jordan claims that such organizations worked with the government to censor conservative speech online. Although research groups may have reported problematic content, "no evidence has emerged that government officials coerced the companies to take action against accounts". Researchers argue that they have academic freedom to study social media and disinformation as well as freedom of speech to report their results.
Previous research has indicated that sharing of disinformation and propaganda within the United States has been associated with the development of increasingly "partisan" media, appearing most strongly in right-wing sources such as Breitbart, The Daily Caller, and Fox News.
The actions of Jordan and the House Judiciary Committee have been described as an "attempt to chill research", creating a "chilling effect" through increased time demands, legal costs and online harassment of researchers.


=== Health care and drug policy ===
Jordan opposes the Affordable Care Act, calling for it to be repealed.  He opposes vaccine requirements, describing them as "un-American".
Since coming into office, Jordan has voted in opposition to efforts to liberalize federal marijuana policy. Jordan supports the permanent classification of  "fentanyl-related substances" as Schedule I drugs under the Controlled Substances Act. In 2017, Jordan argued that "the most beneficial things can be done at a local level" in responding to the opioid epidemic.


=== Environment ===
In July 2008, Jordan was the first member of Congress to sign the "No Climate Tax" pledge drafted by the conservative political advocacy group Americans for Prosperity.
In Congress, Jordan voted to open the Outer Continental Shelf to oil drilling, prevent the EPA from regulating greenhouse gases, and bar greenhouse gases from Clean Air Act rules. He voted against enforcing limits on carbon dioxide global warming pollution, tax credits for renewable electricity, tax incentives for renewable energy and energy conservation, and curtailing subsidies for oil and gas company exploration.


=== Abortion ===
Jordan opposes abortion, and supports banning federal funding to Planned Parenthood.
On July 12, 2022, Jordan tweeted to The Washington Examiner that a report of a 10-year-old Ohio girl traveling to Indiana to obtain a legal abortion after being raped was a lie. He deleted the tweet on July 13 after the rapist was arrested by police and confessed to raping the girl twice, and police confirmed that the report of her abortion in Indiana was accurate.


=== Taxes ===
While serving in the Ohio Senate, Jordan supported the Tax and Expenditure Limitation Amendment, a state constitutional amendment that would require a vote of the people to raise taxes or increase spending over certain limits.


=== Foreign policy ===
Jordan was among 60 Republicans to oppose condemning Trump's action of withdrawing forces from Syria. According to The American Conservative, along with Matt Gaetz and a handful of Republicans, he broke with the party and voted to end Saudi assistance to the war in Yemen.
In June 2021, Jordan was one of 49 House Republicans to vote to repeal the AUMF against Iraq. In 2023, Jordan was among 47 Republicans to vote in favor of H.Con.Res. 21 which directed President Joe Biden to remove U.S. troops from Syria within 180 days.
Since the onset of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Jordan has reportedly voted in opposition to almost all bills to provide military assistance to Ukraine.
Jordan endorsed providing aid to Israel in the wake of the 2023 Israel–Hamas war.


=== LGBT rights ===
In 2015, Jordan cosponsored a resolution to amend the US constitution to ban same-sex marriage. Jordan condemned the Supreme Court ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, which held that same-sex marriage bans violated the Constitution.


=== Veterans ===
The PACT ACT which expanded VA benefits to veterans exposed to toxic chemicals during their military service, received a "nay" from Jordan. Regarding cannabis, despite lobbying from VSOs such as the DAV, Jordan also voted against the 2016 Veterans Equal Access Amendment.


=== COVID-19 ===
Jordan supported protests in April 2020 that opposed government lockdowns intended to curb the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Jordan opposes vaccine mandates, calling them "un-American". Jordan criticized Anthony Fauci during congressional hearings over his pandemic policy recommendations, and in 2021 called on Fauci to resign. In December 2021, when the mortality toll from COVID-19 in the United States averaged 1,659 deaths per day, Jordan declared that "Real America is done with COVID-19. The only people who don't understand that are Fauci and Biden." In 2023, Jordan invited anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to testify before Congress about alleged censorship of his opinions on social media. Jordan defended a tweet by Kennedy which implied that Hank Aaron, who died in 2021 of natural causes, had passed away due to Aaron being administered the COVID-19 vaccine. Jordan said Kennedy's tweet was not "factually inaccurate. Hank Aaron, real person, great American, passed away after he got the vaccine. Pointing out, just pointing out facts."


== Personal life ==
Jordan and his wife, Polly, live near Urbana, Ohio, in central Champaign County. They were introduced by her brothers, with whom Jordan competed in wrestling. Polly and Jordan started dating when he was 13 and she was 14. They have four children and two grandchildren. Jordan's son-in-law, Jarrod Uthoff, is a professional basketball player.

Michael Anthony Rulli (born March 11, 1969) is an American politician, musician and businessman who is serving as the  U.S. representative for Ohio's 6th congressional district. He previously served as an Ohio State Senator for the 33rd district from 2019 until June 12, 2024. He is a member of the Republican Party.
Rulli is the director of operations at Rulli Bros. Markets, a family-owned chain of grocery stores based in the Mahoning Valley region.


== Early life ==
Born on March 11, 1969, Rulli is a graduate of Poland Seminary High School and the United States Naval Sea Cadet Corps. He went on to earn bachelor's degrees in communications and speech from Emerson College in 1991. While studying in Boston, Rulli also interned for Joseph P. Kennedy II and played in the grunge band Red Bliss. After graduation, he joined his family's business, Rulli Bros. Markets. Initially a Democrat, he later joined the Republican Party.


== Career ==
Rulli was first elected to the Ohio Senate in 2018, defeating incumbent Ohio House of Representatives member and former U.S. representative John Boccieri. Prior to that contest, Rulli's only other political experience was as a School Board member for the Leetonia Exempted Village School District in Columbiana County, Ohio. Rulli was re-elected in 2022, defeating former Ohio House and Ohio Senate member Bob Hagan.


=== Ohio Senate Tenure ===
In 2019, Rulli was one of 12 Senators to vote against HB 6, the legislation at the center of one of the nation's largest corruption scandals. 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Rulli championed legislation to prevent municipalities from banning the use of plastic grocery bags. The House version of Rulli's legislation, HB 242 was signed into law by Governor Mike DeWine in October 2020.  
In January 2024, Rulli voted to override Governor DeWine's veto of HB 68, a bill banning gender-affirming care for minors and prohibiting transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports.
Rulli became the Republican nominee on March 19, 2024 for the 2024 special election for Ohio's 6th congressional district, and defeated Democrat Michael Kripchak on June 11. On June 12 Rulli announced his resignation from the Ohio Senate. Rulli was sworn in to the 118th U.S. Congress on June 25, 2024.
Then-state representative Al Cutrona was sworn in to Rulli's former Senate seat on June 26.
On November 5, 2024, Rulli won re-election with about 66% of the vote, running again against Michael Kripchak.


=== Hiring of Mike Peppel ===
In January 2025, Rulli hired Mike Peppel as his communications director. Peppel had previously served as Rulli's senior legislative aide from January 2019 to March 2023. Prior to working for Rulli, Peppel worked for former Republican Congressman Bill Johnson, serving as political director for Johnson's campaign and as his office's community outreach representative.
In 2023, Peppel founded the Ohio Clean Water Fund (OCWF), which was the subject of a seven-count civil lawsuit filed by Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost. The lawsuit alleged that OCWF was a "sham charity" that falsely claimed to be raising money for those impacted by the East Palestine train derailment, misrepresenting its use of funds. While Peppel disputed the allegations, he ultimately settled the lawsuit. The settlement resolved all claims against Peppel, avoiding protracted litigation.
Rulli, in a prepared statement, affirmed his support for Peppel, citing his experience and dedication to the region.


== Personal life ==
Rulli resides in Salem, Ohio, with his wife Kelly and their two children.
On November 28, 2022, Rulli fired a handgun at two teenagers he believed were trespassing on his property. Later, his wife, Kelly Rulli, fired shots at one of the teenagers and his family members who had returned to retrieve hunting equipment. While Rulli claims he fired warning shots into the ground from a distance of approximately 15 yards, the teenager maintains he was much farther away on his uncle's land and that the shots were fired directly at him. A special prosecutor's investigation, which found no physical evidence (such as shell casings or bullets), concluded that the Rullis' actions were reasonable under the circumstances and declined to press charges against either party, though it did determine the teenagers were trespassing. The incident remains disputed, with conflicting accounts of the events.

== U.S House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 2016 special ====

After Representative John Boehner resigned from the U.S. House of Representatives, Davidson ran in a special election for the balance of Boehner’s 13th term, recruited heavily by fellow Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan. Davidson won the 15-way primary, all but guaranteeing his victory in the heavily Republican district's special election on June 7. He was sworn in on June 9.

Davidson is a member of the budget and spending task force on the Republican Study Committee.
In July 2020, Davidson founded the Sound Money Caucus, a caucus focused on maintaining financial stability and Dollar hegemony. He serves as its chair.
In 2019, Davidson made an unsuccessful bid for chair of the caucus after Representative Mark Meadows vacated the position, ultimately withdrawing in favor of Andy Biggs. Davidson has served as the caucus's policy chair since October 2019.

On January 7, 2021, Davidson objected to the certification of electors in the 2020 US presidential election, alleging widespread voter fraud. 
In September 2021, nonprofit group Campaign Legal Center filed an ethics complaint against Davidson with the Office of Congressional Ethics, claiming that Davidson appeared to have violated the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act of 2012, a federal transparency and conflict-of-interest law, by failing to properly disclose a sale of stock in Workhorse Group worth between $50,000 and $100,000 that he made in 2020. In response, a spokesperson for Davidson claimed that the proper financial disclosure form had been filed on time but that the House Clerk's website had failed to publish it.
In January 2022, Davidson faced backlash from Jewish groups after comparing a Washington, D.C. city ordinance requiring display of photo identification and proof of COVID-19 vaccination to enter businesses to the Holocaust.
On March 19, 2024, Davidson voted "nay" to House Resolution 149 Condemning the illegal abduction and forcible transfer of children from Ukraine to the Russian Federation. He was one of nine Republicans to do so.

== Political positions ==


=== Abortion ===
Davidson is staunchly anti-abortion except to save the mother's life. On August 12, 2020, he and Senator Mike Braun co-wrote a letter to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin urging him to direct the IRS not to treat premiums for health insurance that covers abortions as medical care, writing, "in all but the most extreme circumstances, abortion is an elective procedure."
On June 26, 2022, when asked by Pamela Brown on CNN Newsroom whether he was okay with a child rape victim carrying out a pregnancy, he said, "It's a compromise. Like I say, rape is raised as an objection and the Heartbeat Bill already deals with that and it's hard to conceive of somebody who doesn't know they were raped for two months."


=== Disaster relief ===
Davidson voted against disaster relief for Puerto Rico and against raising the debt limit to provide Hurricane Harvey relief.


=== U.S. Capitol Police ===
In June 2021, Davidson was one of 21 House Republicans to vote against a resolution to give the Congressional Gold Medal to police officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on January 6.


=== Foreign policy and the military ===
Davidson and Jim Jordan were the only members of Ohio's congressional delegation and two of 60 members of Congress to vote against a bipartisan resolution condemning President Donald Trump's unilateral withdrawal of U.S. military forces from Syria, which passed the House 354–60 in October 2019. Davidson justified the position in an op-ed that called for an outright rejection of neoconservative foreign policy, in which he wrote, "the neoconservative consensus has left America less free, less safe, and burdened by unprecedented debt." He also urged NATO to stipulate that any actions Turkey took against groups like the Kurds in response to U.S. withdrawal should be treated as genocide and be grounds for removal as a treaty signatory.
Davidson voted against the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021, citing, among other things, "funding for military activity in Afghanistan with no change in strategy or plan to withdraw troops".
In June 2021, Davidson was one of 49 House Republicans to vote to repeal the AUMF against Iraq.
In 2023, Davidson voted to provide Israel with support following the October 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel.


=== Health care ===
Davidson supports Republican efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.


=== Intelligence and surveillance activities ===
Davidson supports curtailing many of the broad signals intelligence permissions granted in the wake of the September 11 attacks, which he has called an "extralegal spying regime" of "vague laws and lax protections". He has worked to orchestrate several major attempts to reform the laws in recent years.
The first major attempt at reform came in January 2020 when Davidson co-sponsored H.R. 5675, The Safeguarding Americans' Private Records Act (SAPRA) alongside the notably unusual coalition of Progressive Caucus Democrats like Pramila Jayapal and Freedom Caucus Republicans like Matt Gaetz. The bill aimed at significant reforms, including new transparency of FISA Court decisions and ensuring 4th amendment constraints on "tangible things" requests subsequent to the decision in Carpenter v. United States. Efforts stalled after House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler canceled markup on the bill at the request of House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff.
Another came during debate over reauthorization of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), when Davidson worked with Representative Zoe Lofgren to introduce the Lofgren-Davidson Amendment. The amendment was to serve as an outright prohibition on warrantless search of American's internet activities by the Intelligence Community via Section 215 of FISA empowered by the USA FREEDOM Act (aka the Library Records provision). Reauthorization of the soon-to-expire Section 215 concerned a set of provisions known informally as the “business records” power, the “call detail records” authority, the “roving wiretaps” provision, and the never-used “lone wolf” amendment. Among other reforms, the new language would have constrained these powers by creating an affirmative burden on the government to be absolutely sure the target in question is not a U.S. person before obtaining internet records, and make unlawful the incidental collection of U.S. persons' data via selection of all web traffic data for a particular video, search query, or webpage. In addition, if an order could result in a U.S. person's data, it would be unlawful without a warrant narrowly tailored to a specific subject. It also included a provision to eliminate the lone wolf amendment. The proposal mirrored a companion Senate amendment by Senators Ron Wyden and Steve Daines, which had narrowly failed in the Senate. Davidson said he would support reauthorization of FISA so long as the amendment was included.
After House Intelligence Committee chair Adam Schiff made a statement to the New York Times suggesting that the Lofgren-Davidson amendment would not completely eliminate warrantless surveillance, Davidson and Wyden quickly abandoned support of the amendment over fears that the agreement reached between Lofgren and Schiff over the weekend had betrayed much of the intent of the amendment with omissions and loopholes to be interpreted maliciously by the secretive FISA Court. Both went on to oppose the amendment and underlying reauthorization bill, with Davidson saying, "this is Representative Schiff and intelligence hawks working overtime to protect the surveillance state status quo." The entire bill was later pulled by Speaker Pelosi after Trump indicated he would veto and moderate Republicans indicated opposition. Barring further action Section 215 powers lie dormant, as authority expired March 15, 2020.
After Attorney General William Barr tried to suggest that FISA could be reauthorized with assurances the Justice Department would fix abuses through administrative rulemaking, Davidson pushed back against suggestions that any agency decisions could stand in for crucial legislative reform.
Davidson cited compromises of "Americans’ privacy in the name of fighting terror" as a reason for his vote against the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021.

Michael Ray Turner (born January 11, 1960) is an American politician serving as the U.S. representative from Ohio's 10th congressional district since 2013. He is a member of the Republican Party. Turner's district, numbered as the 3rd district from 2003 to 2013, contains Dayton and Springfield, taking in part of Clark County and all of Montgomery and Greene Counties. He has served on the House Intelligence Committee including as its chair. He was removed as chair by Speaker Johnson. He served as mayor of Dayton, Ohio.
Turner served as the president of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly from 2014 to 2016. He is known for his hawkish national security stances.


== Early life, education, and career ==
Turner was born in 1960 in Dayton, Ohio, to Vivian and Ray Turner. His mother was a teacher in the Wayne School system in Huber Heights and his father worked as a member of IUE Local 801 for 42 years after serving in the military. Turner was raised in East Dayton and has one sister. He is a non-denominational Protestant Christian.
Turner graduated from Belmont High School in 1978 and received his Bachelor of Arts in political science from the Ohio Northern University in 1982, a Juris Doctor from Case Western Reserve University in 1985, a Master of Business Administration from the University of Dayton in 1992, and a Doctor of Liberal Studies in urban economic development from Georgetown University in 2022. He practiced law with local firms and businesses in the Dayton area before entering politics. He also practiced law during the brief time between his service as mayor of Dayton and as a member of Congress.


== Mayor of Dayton ==
Turner was elected mayor of Dayton, Ohio, in 1993, narrowly defeating incumbent Mayor Richard Clay Dixon. Before he took office, the city suffered a number of economic setbacks. Upon taking office, Turner focused on attracting business to the city and on redeveloping vacant and underutilized real estate packages known as brownfields.
During Turner's mayoralty, Dayton reached an agreement to construct a baseball stadium for a class A minor league team affiliated with the Cincinnati Reds.
Turner was the mayor of Dayton during the planning and construction of the Schuster Center, which he supported for its contribution to reviving downtown. He facilitated discussions with key leaders from the project's conception to its completion. The Schuster Center is a performing arts center at the corner of Second and Main Streets. It has served as a forum for the Victoria Theatre's Broadway Series, the Dayton Philharmonic Orchestra, the Dayton Ballet, and a speaking location for visiting political leaders, such as former New York governor Mario Cuomo.

Turner also started a program called "Rehabarama", which attracted professionals to historic properties in the city. He was reelected in 1997 over Democratic city commissioner Tony Capizzi. In 2001 he lost to then state senator Rhine McLin, 51.6% to 48.4%.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===
2002

Turner received 58% of the vote following the retirement of 23-year incumbent Democrat Tony P. Hall from Congress after President George W. Bush named Hall U.N. special envoy for hunger issues. Earlier that year, Turner won the Republican nomination when he defeated Roy Brown with 80% of the vote. Brown was the son and grandson of former area Republican congressmen Bud Brown and Clarence J. Brown and operated a local newspaper company, Brown Publishing. In the general election, Turner defeated Congressman Tony Hall's chief of staff, Rick Carne, after Carne won the Democratic nomination. Turner got a substantial assist from the 2000s round of redistricting. The old 3rd had been a fairly compact district centered on Dayton, but redistricting added some Republican-leaning suburbs to the east.

2004

In 2004, Turner defeated former businesswoman Jane Mitakides with over 62% of the vote. The district was considered a key area in the swing state of Ohio in that year's presidential race.

2006

In 2006, the Democrats planned to target Turner for defeat. Three Democrats entered the Third District primary to run against Turner in the general election. Veterinarian Stephanie Studebaker defeated local bankruptcy attorney David Fierst and recalled Waynesville mayor Charles W. Sanders. Studebaker had previously affiliated with former Vermont governor Howard Dean's 2004 presidential campaign in Ohio. After winning the nomination, she and her husband Sam were both arrested for domestic violence. Studebaker subsequently dropped out of the race, citing her family concerns and impending legal issues. After her withdrawal, four Democrats entered a special primary to face Turner, won by former assistant United States attorney Richard Chema. Turner defeated Chema with 58% of the vote.

2008

Jane Mitakides beat Sanders in the Democratic primary and faced Turner in a rematch from 2004. Turner again focused largely on economic issues of job creation and protection for workers affected by the national and regional recession. In a difficult political climate for Republicans, Turner defeated Mitakides with 64% of the vote, his largest margin of victory in any election.

2010

Turner was challenged by first-time Democratic nominee 25-year-old Joe Roberts in the general election and won with 68% of the vote.

2012

After redistricting, Turner's district was renumbered the 10th district. It absorbed much of the neighboring 7th district, represented by fellow Republican Steve Austria. The district was made significantly more compact than its predecessor, absorbing all of Dayton.
It initially looked like Turner would face Austria in a primary, but Austria dropped out of the race, handing Turner the nomination. Turner then defeated Democratic attorney Sharon Neuhardt with 60% of the vote.

2020

Turner was challenged in the 2020 Republican primary by Kathi Flanders.


=== Tenure ===

Turner is a member of the Armed Services and Government Reform committees. In 2009, he was named Ranking Member on the Strategic Forces Subcommittee of the United States House Committee on Armed Services.
In January 2003, Turner was appointed to the Armed Services Committee, a position he has used to advocate for the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in his district, and to the Government Reform Committee.
Due to his urban background, focus on the economic redevelopment of cities, and service as Dayton's mayor, Turner is sometimes described as an "urban Republican". Recognizing Turner's work on urban development, then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert appointed Turner chair of the Saving America's Cities working group. The group was formed to work with the Bush administration to "foster economic development and redevelopment and streamline government services in America's cities to help them prosper and grow."
During the 109th Congress, Turner served on the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, in addition to his work on his two other committees, the House Armed Services and Government Reform Committees.
Serving on the Armed Services Committee, Turner advocated for an expansion to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, providing testimony to the Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC). This effort proved successful in 2008, when the Air Force announced that 1,000 jobs and over $230 million in federal funding would move to Wright-Patterson AFB. Turner has said that this is the largest single investment in Wright-Patterson since World War II.
In 2006, the Dayton Development Coalition (DDC), a nonprofit and nominally nonpartisan group (though most of the trustees have contributed to Turner's campaigns) that advocates for federal funds for economic development in the Miami Valley, began a regional branding campaign. Turner's wife's company Turner Effect was awarded a contract without competitive bidding to conduct the marketing research associated with the campaign. In April 2008, Turner Effect withdrew from the branding implementation contract after more details of the agreement became public, including details about the more than $300,000 awarded to her company.
The DDC said that its members were "unanimous" in their decision that there was "no conflict [of interest]" in their having chosen Turner's company, but watchdog groups and media reports raised concerns about a possible conflict of interest.
In the same year, Turner's campaign committee Citizens for Turner contracted with Turner Effect for professional services, such as the production of literature.
On July 7, 2008, Turner wrote an op-ed in the Hillsboro Times-Gazette in support of the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008, referred to as the GI Bill. In May of that year, Turner opposed an earlier version of the GI Bill. Turner has been endorsed by the Veterans of Foreign Wars PAC.
In October 2008, Turner joined then Senator Hillary Clinton, First Lady Laura Bush, Senator Pete Domenici and Representative Brad Miller to announce the introduction of bipartisan legislation that would permanently authorize two historic preservation grant programs. The bill, H.R. 3981, would permanently authorize the programs known as "Save America's Treasures", established by the Clinton administration, and "Preserve America", established by the Bush administration. It was introduced in the House by Turner and Miller as co-chairs of the Congressional Historic Preservation Caucus and in the Senate by Clinton and Domenici. The two grant programs are complementary. Preserve America supports "community efforts to demonstrate sustainable uses of their historic and cultural sites, focusing on economic and educational opportunities related to heritage tourism." The Save America's Treasures grant program "funds 'bricks-and-mortar' projects by helping local communities develop sustainable resource management strategies and sound business practices for the continued preservation and use of heritage assets."
In June 2009, Turner introduced H.J. Res 57, the "Preserving Capitalism in America" amendment to the United States Constitution. This amendment, which has 104 cosponsors in the House, would prohibit the United States government from owning any stock in corporations. The amendment did not become law.
In February 2010, Turner released a report on "The Impact of the Housing Crisis on Local Communities and the Federal Response" in conjunction with the Northeast-Midwest Institute and the Northeast-Midwest Congressional Coalition. The report included testimony and proposals from Dayton community leaders such as Commissioner Dean Lovelace and Miami Valley Fair Housing Center CEO Jim McCarthy, who participated in an August 2009 housing and foreclosure crisis forum in Dayton. Turner indicated he would offer legislation based on the recommendations of the report.
Turner voted against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 and in the coming years repeatedly voted for its repeal. He opposed the "$1 trillion government takeover of our nation's health care system" because it would "increase budget deficits and decrease the quality of our health care services", he said.
Turner was highly critical of the Obama administration's Phased Adaptive Approach and Nuclear Posture Review regarding the protection and defense of the U.S. and allies.
In 2012, Turner called for a missile defense site on the east coast of the United States, to defend against missiles launched from Iran. The east coast site would be the third such site, joining two others on the west coast designed to defend against an attack from North Korea.
In 2018, Turner was named to the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. That year, Turner pushed for the establishment of the National Advanced Air Mobility Center of Excellence in Ohio, catalyzing the facility's eventual construction at the Springfield–Beckley Municipal Airport.

After the Dayton shooting in August 2019, Turner announced he would back legislation barring the "sale of military-style weapons to civilians" and also said he would support a limit on magazines and the creation of legislation that would keep guns from people deemed dangerous by the police. He had previously "generally backed gun-rights measures during his nine terms in the House", earning a 93% approval and "A" rating from the NRA Political Victory Fund (NRA-PVF) in prior years. Turner's daughter had been across the street from the attack. For the 2020 election the NRA-PVF gave Turner a "D" rating. In 2018 and 2019 he "led the Ohio congressional delegation... in advocating to bring the F-35 program" to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, which happened in May 2019. As of May 2019, he was the top Republican on the House Armed Service's Strategic Forces Subcommittee. In April 2019, he created a panel to "independently review" the water quality in the Dayton area.
Turner was one of three Ohio Republicans appointed to an Intelligence Committee that examined whether Trump had improperly withheld aid to Ukraine. He stated the conversation between Trump and the Ukrainian president was "not ok", but that impeachment was an "assault" on the electorate. On November 19, 2019, Trump praised his questioning of witnesses in the impeachment inquiry in a tweet.
In February 2022, Turner promoted debunked lies about the pleadings John Durham filed as special prosecutor, claiming that they proved that Hillary Clinton "spied" on Trump's presidential campaign and on Trump's White House. Durham denied in open court that these allegations are a truthful interpretation of his pleadings, but Turner continued to publicly disseminate the allegations.
Following accusations that Donald Trump had kept classified documents at Mar-a-Lago after his presidency ended, Turner said on Fox News that he thought the matter was "more like a bookkeeping issue than it is a national security threat".
On March 18, 2024, Turner indicated that he did not believe Donald Trump had been calling for violence when he used the word "blood bath" in a speech. "The president's statements concerning 'blood bath' were about what would happen in the auto industry if actually the Chinese manufacturers who are coming into Mexico were permitted to import into the United States," Turner said.
On January 15, 2025, Turner was removed as chair of the House Intelligence Committee by Speaker of the House Mike Johnson ahead of Donald Trump's second presidential term. Turner said that Johnson cited "concerns from Mar-a-Lago" when removing him, while Johnson denied to reporters that the removal was a "President Trump decision".


=== Political positions ===


==== 2020 election ====
Turner did not join the majority of Republican members of Congress who signed an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election.
Turner voted to certify both Arizona's and Pennsylvania's results in the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count.


==== China ====
In June 2020, Turner cosponsored the Holding China Accountable Act, which would restrict visas for Chinese nationals entering the United States to study, work, or attend business meetings in “science, technology, engineering, mathematics, or a related field.”


==== LGBT rights ====
On July 19, 2022, Turner and 46 other Republican representatives voted for the Respect for Marriage Act, which would codify the right to same-sex marriage in federal law.


==== Syria ====
In 2023, Turner voted against H.Con.Res. 21 which directed President Joe Biden to remove U.S. troops from Syria within 180 days.


=== Sutorina dispute involvement ===
On March 3, 2015, Montenegrin, Bosnian, and other Balkan-based news agencies reported that Turner had involved himself in the Sutorina dispute between Bosnia and Montenegro, sending a letter of warning to Bosniak member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Bakir Izetbegovic in which he suggested that if Bosnia did not give up its territorial dispute over Sutorina the United States might suspend its aid to Bosnia.

== Electoral history ==


== Controversies ==


=== Allegations of self-enrichment ===
In both 2008 and 2010, Turner was listed as one of the "most corrupt members of Congress" by the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington for "enrichment of self, family, or friends" and "solicitation of gifts".
According to analysis conducted by the Dayton Daily News in 2016, when Turner came to Congress in 2002, he reported between $153,026 and $695,000 worth of assets on his financial disclosure form. In 2016, he claimed between $2.8 million and $10.3 million. The paper credited his second marriage to an energy lobbyist as a contributing reason for the increase, since her assets as well as his were listed on his 2016 financial disclosure form. Their relationship raised red flags when Turner was accused of authoring natural gas legislation that might benefit her employer at the time, Cheniere Energy.


=== Absence of local town halls ===
At multiple times during his tenure in Congress, Turner has faced protests from constituents for refusing to host public town hall events, presumably over fear that the events would draw strong backlash from constituents over repeated efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act that Republicans in neighboring districts and around the country experienced.


== Personal life ==
In 1987, Turner married Lori Turner, a health executive. They have two daughters. After 25 years of marriage, they announced their separation in 2012 and divorced in 2013.
Turner married Majida Mourad on December 19, 2015, at Westminster Presbyterian Church in downtown Dayton. Representative Darrell Issa was a groomsman at the wedding. In May 2017, after less than two years of marriage, Turner filed for divorce from Mourad, alleging that Mourad "is guilty of a fraudulent contract". As part of the acrimonious divorce, Turner's lawyers wrote to Issa "stating they would like to depose" him, but lawyers for both sides later released a statement that "Majida Mourad and Congressman Michael Turner have come to a resolution".

==== 2018 special ====

Balderson was the Republican nominee for Ohio's 12th congressional district in an August 7, 2018 special election triggered by the January 2018 resignation of Representative Pat Tiberi. He narrowly won the May Republican primary, with 20,101 votes (29.2%) to second-place finisher Melanie Leneghan's 19,437. Leneghan sued, asking to be declared the winner because of voting irregularities. The Ohio Supreme Court dismissed her suit in August 2018.
In the August election, Balderson faced Democratic nominee Danny O'Connor. On election night, the results were too close to call; Balderson was officially certified as the winner on August 24. After the remaining absentee and provisional ballots were counted, Balderson won by 1,680 votes (0.8%), and was sworn into office on September 5.

David Patrick Joyce (born March 17, 1957) is an American politician and attorney currently serving in the United States House of Representatives for Ohio's 14th congressional district since 2013. A member of the Republican Party, Joyce was previously the prosecutor of Geauga County, Ohio.
He chairs the Republican Governance Group, a group of moderate Republicans in the United States House of Representatives .


== Early life and education ==
Joyce was born in Cleveland, Ohio, to an Irish Catholic family. His father was a coal salesman. In high school, he played football, and considered joining the priesthood. In 1975, Joyce enrolled at the University of Dayton, a Catholic university, from which he received a Bachelor of Science degree in accounting in 1979, and later his Juris Doctor.


== Legal career ==
From 1983 to 1984, Joyce was a public defender for Cuyahoga County, and from 1985 to 1988 a public defender for Geauga County. In 1989, he was hired as an assistant county attorney in Lake County. He assisted County Prosecutor Steven C. LaTourette in prosecuting serial murderer and cult leader Jeffrey Lundgren for the Kirtland cult killings.
By 2012, Joyce had been appointed prosecutor of Geauga County. He prosecuted the 2012 Chardon High School shooting of six students that took place on February 27, 2012. The defendant, Thomas "T.J." Lane, 17 years old at the time of the crime, was charged as an adult with three counts of aggravated murder, two counts of aggravated attempted murder, and one count of felonious assault. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced in 2013 to three life sentences without parole.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 2012 ====

In July 2012, Representative Steve LaTourette of Ohio's 14th congressional district announced that he would retire in 2012 rather than seek reelection. Because LaTourette announced his retirement after the primary, local Republican party leaders chose Joyce as the replacement nominee.
Joyce ran in the November general election against Democratic nominee Dale Virgil Blanchard, Libertarian David Macko and Green Party nominee Elaine Mastromatteo. He won with 54% of the vote.


==== 2014 ====

In February 2013, Roll Call reported that Steve Israel, head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, had identified the 14th congressional district as one of the party's top four targets in 2014. The House Majority PAC made Joyce one of its top targets to oust in the 2014 elections.
In 2014, according to one news source, Joyce "survived a grueling primary against a Tea Party-backed candidate" before facing "an equally tough challenge from Michael Wager." Joyce won with 63.3% of the vote to Wager's 33% and independent David Macko's 3.7%.


==== 2016 ====

Joyce defeated Wager again, 62.6% to 37.4%.


==== 2018 ====

In April 2017, Betsy Rader, a Democrat, announced that she would run against Joyce in 2018. She is a lawyer who represents victims of employment discrimination. Rader said she supported "much" of the Affordable Care Act, but that she needed to study health care more as an issue. She criticized Joyce for opposing an increase in the minimum wage and for wanting to defund Planned Parenthood.
In October 2017, Darrell Scott, a pastor involved in President Donald Trump's political operation, and who served as CEO of the semi-official "National Diversity Coalition for Trump" organized by Trump's attorney Michael Cohen, said he would consider a primary challenge to Joyce.


==== 2024 ====
On June 12, 2024, Joyce was the only Republican to vote against holding Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt for refusing to release audiotapes of President Biden's interview regarding classified documents. The vote on the GOP-led measure was 216 to 207. He said he couldn't support a "resolution that would further politicize our judicial system to score political points".


=== Tenure ===
Asked about his legislative priorities in March 2016, Joyce cited terrorist threats, job growth, government spending, the national debt, environmental protection of the Great Lakes, and health care.
The Lugar Center and the McCourt School of Public Policy ranked Joyce the 29th most bipartisan member of the House of Representatives during the 114th United States Congress and the most bipartisan member of the House from Ohio.
In July 2017, Joyce said that U.S. political discourse had reached a "vitriolic" level. "I do know there's a level of frustration out there," he said. "But we need to work together. [President Donald Trump] has gotten into this tug-of-war with the national media. Now we're six months into his presidency ... and infrastructure improvements, tax changes and healthcare law are not getting covered. They are dealing with the tweet du Jour ... and [Trump's tweets] certainly don't help."
Joyce is a member of the Republican Main Street Partnership, United States Congressional International Conservation Caucus, Veterinary Medicine Caucus, and the Climate Solutions Caucus. He co-chairs the Congressional Cannabis Caucus.
During Donald Trump's presidency, Joyce voted in line with Trump's stated position 91.8% of the time. As of September 2021, Joyce had voted in line with Joe Biden's stated position 30.6% of the time.
On July 29, 2024, Joyce was announced as one of seven Republican members of a bipartisan task force investigating the attempted assassination of Donald Trump.

== Political positions ==


=== Health care ===
Joyce opposes the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and has voted 31 times to repeal it. In 2017, he voted against a Republican bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, saying it "was too partisan".


=== Jobs ===
In August 2013, Joyce said that part of the problem with unemployment numbers in the U.S. is that employers "can't find people to come to work sober, daily, drug-free and want to learn the necessary skills going forward to be able to do those jobs."


=== Immigration ===
In March 2016, Joyce said that he had co-sponsored "several bills that ensured refugees underwent stricter scrutiny in order to prevent a Paris-style attack from happening in the United States." He supports the Visa Waiver Program in order to "ensure terrorists with Western passports don't enter our country," for restrictions on transferring Guantanamo detainees, and for enhancements in cybersecurity infrastructure. He said, in summary, that he was "committed to giving our soldiers and our intelligence community all of the resources they need to do the job."
Joyce voted for the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020 which authorizes DHS to nearly double the available H-2B visas for the remainder of FY 2020.
Joyce voted for the Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1158), which effectively prohibits ICE from cooperating with Health and Human Services to detain or remove illegal alien sponsors of unaccompanied alien children (UACs).


=== Transportation ===
In 2014, Joyce introduced the Safe Streets Act with Congresswoman Doris Matsui. The bill would nationalize transportation "design elements" so that streets would be designed with the safety of drivers, pedestrians, and bicyclists in mind.


=== Cannabis ===
Joyce has supported a number of congressional efforts to reform cannabis laws. He reintroduced the Rohrabacher–Farr amendment in 2018 to prohibit the Justice Department from spending funds to interfere with the implementation of state medical cannabis laws. He also introduced the STATES Act in 2018 and 2019 to protect states from federal interference regarding both medical and recreational use. Also in 2018, Joyce cosponsored the Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act. In January 2019, he was named a co-chair of the Congressional Cannabis Caucus.
In 2021, Joyce introduced the Veterans Medical Marijuana Safe Harbor Act to legalize medical cannabis for military veterans and allow Veterans Affairs doctors to prescribe the drug. Also in 2021, he introduced the Cannabis Reform for Veterans, Small Businesses, and Medical Professionals Act to remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act and direct federal agencies to develop regulations for cannabis similar to alcohol. Later in 2021, he and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez introduced the Harnessing Opportunities by Pursuing Expungement (HOPE) Act to provide grants for state and local governments to expunge cannabis offenses. Joyce endorsed Ohio Issue 2 in 2023 which legalized cannabis for recreational use in his home state.


=== Impeachments of Donald Trump ===
Joyce voted "no" on the first impeachment of Donald Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress on December 18, 2019. On January 13, 2021, he voted against Trump's second impeachment for incitement of insurrection.


=== January 6 commission ===
On May 19, 2021, Joyce was one of 35 Republicans who joined all Democrats in voting to approve legislation to establish the January 6 commission meant to investigate the storming of the U.S. Capitol.


=== Censure of Paul Gosar ===
In November 2021, Joyce refused to vote to censure Paul Gosar, a House member who approvingly shared an animated video himself killing a fellow member and assaulting the president. Joyce voted "Present."


=== LGBT rights ===
On July 19, 2022, Joyce and 46 other Republican representatives voted for the Respect for Marriage Act, which would codify the right to same-sex marriage in federal law.


=== Suspending the US Constitution ===
In a nationally broadcast December 2022 interview, Joyce said that, regardless of Donald Trump's calls to suspend the Constitution of the United States, he would support him for president were Trump to win the Republican nomination in 2024.


=== SANEs Act ===
In February 2022, Joyce and Representative Deborah Ross introduced the Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners (SANEs) Act, which is designed to address the nationwide shortage of Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners and improve care for survivors of sexual violence. The bill was endorsed by RAINN, the American Nurses Association, and the National Network to End Domestic Violence.


== Personal life ==
Joyce married Kelly in 1990. They live in Russell Township with their three children. Joyce is a member of the National District Attorney Association and the Ohio Prosecuting Attorney Association. He is also director of Geauga Bluecoats Inc. He is Catholic.

Michael Todd Whitaker Carey (born March 13, 1971) is an American politician and former coal lobbyist serving as the U.S. representative for Ohio's 15th congressional district. A member of the Republican Party, Carey was first elected in a 2021 special election.


== Early life and education ==
Carey was raised in Sabina, Ohio. After attending East Clinton High School, he earned an Associate of Arts degree in economics from the Marion Military Institute and a Bachelor of Arts in history from Ohio State University.
Carey is Roman Catholic.


== Career ==

Carey served in the Army National Guard from 1989 to 1999. As a college student, he worked as an aide to State Senator Merle G. Kearns. Carey, prior to his election, worked as vice president of government affairs for American Consolidated Natural Resources, a coal company. He was also chairman of the board of the Ohio Coal Association, prior to stepping down following his congressional run. During the 2004 and 2008 presidential elections, Carey developed negative campaign ads against Democratic nominees John Kerry and Barack Obama.
As a result of his past career in the coal industry, Carey considers himself a "an advocate for coal miners and American energy independence" and prioritizes development of energy policy in the House of Representatives.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 2021 special ====

Carey was the Republican nominee in the 2021 15th congressional district special election. He was endorsed by former President Donald Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence.
Carey received the most financial contributions out of all 11 candidates in the Republican primary, including from out-of-state donors and individuals in the coal and mining industries. Political commentators and journalists called the race "a test of Trump's influence over Republican politics." Carey won the special election on November 2.


=== 117th Congress ===
On July 19, 2022, Carey and 46 other Republican representatives voted for the Respect for Marriage Act, which would codify the right to same-sex marriage in federal law. On July 28, 2022, Carey and 24 other Republican representatives voted for the CHIPS Act, increasing governmental funding for domestic semiconductor production.
In late 2022, Carey announced his "complete" endorsement of Trump.


==== 2022 midterm elections ====
In the 2022 midterm elections, Carey defeated the Democratic nominee, union leader Gary Josephson. Carey raised around $2.3 million for this election, the 251st-highest sum among elected representatives.


=== 118th Congress ===
Before the 118th Congress, Carey declared his support for Kevin McCarthy's bid for House Speaker amid controversy about McCarthy's leadership following the 2022 midterm elections. Carey also announced his intention to "get on the Ways and Means Committee" in the 118th Congress. In mid-2023, Carey announced the re-launch of the "House Civility and Respect Caucus" with Representative Joyce Beatty, originally formed by Representative Steve Stivers and Beatty.

Joshua Chad Brecheen (, brə-KEEN, born June 19, 1979) is an American politician from the U.S. state of Oklahoma who has served as the U.S. representative for Oklahoma's 2nd congressional district since 2023. A member of the Republican Party, he represented the 6th district in the Oklahoma Senate from 2010 to 2018. He is a citizen of the Choctaw Nation.


== Early life and career ==
Joshua Chad Brecheen was born on June 19, 1979. He attended Southeastern Oklahoma State University in Durant. In 1997, he was first elected as SE District Vice-president of the Oklahoma FFA. The next year, he was elected State FFA President, moved to Stillwater, and transferred to Oklahoma State University. He served as State FFA President until 1999.
After retiring from the FFA, Brecheen graduated from Oklahoma State University with a dual degree in animal science and agricultural communications. In 2004, he was hired as a field representative for U.S. senator Tom Coburn, where he worked until his election to the Oklahoma Senate. He owns a motivational speaking business, Brecheen Keynotes and Seminars, as well as Rawhide Dirtworks, an excavation service.


== Oklahoma Senate career ==
Brecheen filed to run for the Oklahoma Senate's 6th district in 2010. He ran unopposed in the Republican primary and faced incumbent Democratic Senator Jay Paul Gumm. Brecheen defeated Gumm in the November election. The Tulsa World reported the 6th Senate district race as having the highest fundraising total for a State Senate seat in 2010, with Brecheen raising $217,548 and Gumm $289,786.
During his first term, Brecheen filed a bill to repeal Oklahoma's Pet Breeders Act, which required breeders provide their animals with minimum veterinary care, food and water. The bill established fees that pet breeders would pay the state to cover the costs of inspections. Brecheen argued the bill punished law-abiding citizens. He also filed a Senate resolution to have the Oklahoma Legislature meet every other year instead of annually and cut legislators pay, and introduced legislation to cut the Art in Public Places program, which provided funding to public art projects in the state. Brecheen also filed SB 554 to allow teachers to teach "the debate of creation vs. evolution" in Oklahoma public schools.
Brecheen served in the Oklahoma Senate until 2018. He retired after two terms, citing a commitment to term limits.
Brecheen was criticized by the National Center for Science Education for introducing several education bills modeled on anti-evolution bills from Texas, Tennessee, and Louisiana during his senate tenure.

In 2022, Brecheen ran for Oklahoma's 2nd congressional district in a 14-candidate Republican primary to succeed retiring congressman Markwayne Mullin. Mullin retired to run in a special election for U.S. Senate. He styled himself during the campaign as "Tom Coburn's protégé" and vowed to vote "no" on any tax increases. Brecheen advanced to a runoff election with state Representative Avery Frix after placing second in the primary. He narrowly defeated Frix in the runoff, winning the nomination. During the primary Brecheen's campaign was supported by $3.2 million in political action committee spending in support of his campaign or in opposition to Frix, including $1.8 million in support from a Club for Growth affiliated political action committee. He defeated Democratic nominee Naomi Andrews and independent "Bulldog" Ben Robinson in the general election.

Frank Dean Lucas (born January 6, 1960) is an American politician serving as the U.S. representative for Oklahoma's 3rd congressional district since 2003, having previously represented the 6th district from 1994 to 2003. A member of the Republican Party, Lucas has chaired the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology since 2023. His district, numbered as the 6th from 1994 to 2003, is Oklahoma's largest congressional district and one of the largest in the nation that does not cover an entire state. It covers 34,088.49 square miles and stretches from the Panhandle to the fringes of the Tulsa suburbs, covering almost half of the state's land mass. Lucas is the dean of Oklahoma's congressional delegation.


== United States House of Representatives ==


=== Tenure ===
On April 7, 2014, Lucas introduced the Customer Protection and End User Relief Act (H.R. 4413; 113th Congress) into the House. The bill would reauthorize the Commodity Futures Trading Commission through 2018 and amend some provisions of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.
On January 6, 2021, in the aftermath of the attack on the United States Capitol, Lucas joined 146 other Congressional Republicans in voting against the certification of the 2020 presidential election.
In 2022, Lucas was one of 39 Republicans to vote for the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act of 2022, an antitrust package that would crack down on corporations for anti-competitive behavior.


=== Committee assignments ===
Committee on Agriculture
Committee on Financial Services
Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government Sponsored Enterprises
Subcommittee on Domestic Monetary Policy and Technology
Committee on Science, Space and Technology
Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics
Subcommittee on Energy and Environment


=== Caucus memberships ===
Congressional Blockchain Caucus
Congressional Western Caucus


== Political campaigns ==


=== Oklahoma House of Representatives ===

Lucas first ran for the Oklahoma House of Representatives in 1984 as a Republican against the incumbent Democrat, narrowly losing. A second attempt in 1986 also fell short, but he won in 1988. He lost in 1990 after the legislature made his district somewhat friendlier to Democrats, but he returned in 1992.


=== U. S. House of Representatives ===

In 1994, 6th district Congressman Glenn English stepped down to become a lobbyist for rural electric cooperatives. Lucas won the Republican nomination for the special election on May 10. He faced Dan Webber, press secretary to U.S. Senator David L. Boren. The 6th was already by far the largest in the state, stretching from the Panhandle to the town of Spencer, in the far northeastern Oklahoma City metropolitan area. But the state legislature had redrawn it so that it included many poor Oklahoma City neighborhoods that had never voted Republican. Lucas scored a major upset, winning by eight percentage points and carrying 18 of the district's 24 counties. Some pundits have seen his victory as an early sign of the Republican Revolution that November, when Republicans took control of the House for the first time in 40 years. Lucas won a full term in November with 70% of the vote. He has been reelected seven times, never with less than 59% of the vote, and was unopposed in 2002 and 2004.
Lucas's district was renumbered as the 3rd after Oklahoma lost a district in the 2000 Census. His already vast district was made even larger. He lost most of his share of Oklahoma City, which was home to 60% of the district's population. He once represented much of the downtown area, including the site of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. He still represents the part of the city in Canadian County. To make up for this large population loss, the 3rd was pushed farther east, picking up several of Tulsa's western suburbs (including a small portion of Tulsa itself) and some rural areas. As a result, his district now includes 48.5% of the state's landmass, and is nearly as large as the state's other four districts combined.


=== 2014 Republican primary ===

In the 2014 Republican primary, Lucas won 83% of the vote. 12% went to Robert Hubbard and 5% to Timothy Ray Murray.


=== Chair of the Science, Space and Technology committee ===
After Republicans won the House majority in the 2022 elections, Lucas became chair of the Science, Space and Technology Committee, which has jurisdiction over non-defense federal scientific research and development, including NASA, NSF, NIST, and the OSTP.
Lucas laid out an ambitious agenda for the committee: independence for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a federal program to develop unmanned drones, advances in fusion energy, and research money for institutions other than those on the coasts.


=== 2024 Republican primary ===

Lucas only drew Republican primary challengers in 2024. He will face Robyn Lynn Carder and Darren Hamilton in the June primary.


== Electoral history ==

* English resigned mid-term, and Lucas won the special election to succeed him against Democratic opponent Dan Webber.


== Personal life ==
Lucas is a fifth-generation Oklahoman; his family has farmed in western Oklahoma for over 100 years. He lives in Cheyenne with his wife, Lynda. They have three children and three grandchildren. In August 2023, Lucas underwent hip surgery after being injured on his ranch.

Cliff Stewart Bentz (born January 12, 1952) is an American lawyer, rancher, and politician serving as the U.S. representative for Oregon's 2nd congressional district. A member of the Republican Party, he is the ranking member on the House Natural Resources Committee Subcommittee on Water, Oceans and Wildlife and sits on the House Judiciary Committee. He previously served in the Oregon Senate, representing the 30th district in Eastern Oregon. He also served in the Oregon House of Representatives, representing the 60th district, which encompasses Malheur, Baker, Harney, and Grant counties, and part of Lake County, and includes the cities of Baker City, Burns, and Ontario. Following the departure of Lori Chavez-DeRemer in 2025, Bentz is the sole Republican in Oregon's congressional delegation.
In May 2020, Bentz won the Republican primary for Oregon's 2nd congressional district and faced Democrat Alex Spenser and independent Patrick Archer in November. He was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives on November 3, 2020.
In February 2021 he was made ranking member of the Subcommittee on Water, Oceans and Wildlife.


== Early life and education ==
Bentz was born in Salem, Oregon, and raised on ranches in the eastern Oregon communities of Fields and Drewsey. He graduated from Regis High School in the Willamette Valley city of Stayton in 1970. He received a bachelor's degree from Eastern Oregon State College (now Eastern Oregon University) in 1974 and a J.D. from Lewis & Clark Law School in 1977.


== Career ==
From 1977 to 1980, Bentz was a law associate with the Ontario, Oregon, law firm Yturri Rose, and was made a partner in the firm in 1980, a position he still holds. He specializes in agricultural, water, and real property law. He also owns a 100-acre alfalfa farm.


=== Early political career ===
Bentz began his career as a member of the Oregon Water Resources Commission from 1988 to 1996. He served as chair of the commission from 1994 to 1996.


=== Oregon legislature ===
In 2008, Bentz was appointed by county commissioners in House District 60 to replace Tom Butler in the Oregon House of Representatives after Butler resigned to pursue a church mission. He defeated Tim K. Smith in the Republican primary in May 2008, and was unopposed in the general election. In 2010, Bentz won another term unopposed in both the primary and the general election.
On January 8, 2018, Bentz was sworn in as state senator to replace Ted Ferrioli, who resigned to take a political appointment. Bentz resigned his seat in the Oregon House and was appointed to the senate seat by the county commissioners in the senate district.
Since 2018, Bentz's largest campaign contributors have been Ironside Associates, a London-based security firm; his brother James Bentz; and his farm, Actin Ranch.
Beginning June 20, 2019, all 11 Republican state senators for Oregon, including Bentz, refused to show up for work at the Oregon State Capitol, instead going into hiding, some even fleeing the state. Their aim was to prevent a vote on HB2020, a cap-and-trade proposal that could lower greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 to combat climate change, in part by increasing fuel taxes. The Senate has 30 seats. Without the Republican senators, the remaining 18 Democratic senators could not reach a quorum of 20 to hold a vote. Republican state senators, including Bentz, continued their boycotts in 2020 to prevent the passage of climate change mitigation response, and 2021, after he left for Congress.


==== Committee assignments ====
Bentz served as vice-chair of the following committees: Transportation and Economic Development, Revenue, Joint Tax Credits, Revenue, Tax Expenditures, Carbon Reduction, and Finance and Revenue. He co-chaired the Transportation Committee and was a member of others.

=== Elections ===


==== 2020 ====

Bentz resigned from the Oregon State Senate effective January 2, 2020, to run in the 2020 election for Oregon's 2nd congressional district in the United States House of Representatives. He won the Republican primary and defeated Democrat Alex Spenser and Independent Patrick Archer in the general election.


=== Tenure ===

In the aftermath of the January 6, 2021, storming of the U.S. Capitol, Bentz was reported to have been sheltering in place during the event. In a phone interview with Oregon Public Broadcasting, he declined to call Joe Biden the president-elect, but said any outcome where Biden does not take office was "highly unlikely". The next day, Bentz joined 139 U.S. representatives who objected to Pennsylvania's electoral votes. On January 8, Bentz acknowledged that Biden would become president.
On May 19, 2021, Bentz was one of 35 Republicans who joined all 217 Democrats present in voting to approve legislation to establish the National Commission to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the United States Capitol Complex meant to investigate the storming of the U.S. Capitol.


=== Committee assignments ===
United States House Committee on Natural Resources
Subcommittee on Water, Oceans and Wildlife (Ranking Member)

On March 3, 2022, Bentz and many other Republicans voted against the Honoring our PACT Act of 2021. Bentz was the only member of Oregon's House delegation to do so.
On January 12, 2022, Bentz voted against the Guard and Reserve GI Bill Parity Act, which would expand eligibility for educational assistance under the G.I. Bill.


=== Abortion ===
Bentz describes himself as pro-life, saying, "I believe that life begins at conception and that life should be protected until death by natural causes occurs." He supports abortion only when the mother's life is at risk.
In 2019, Oregon Right to Life gave Bentz the Atterberry Award, which recognizes Oregon legislators who "are tenacious in their public defense of Oregon’s vulnerable."


=== Health care ===
Bentz has said: "I strongly oppose government run healthcare... I believe Obamacare should be replaced with solutions that focus on free market principles to help drive down the skyrocketing cost of healthcare."
On March 31, 2022, Bentz voted against the Affordable Insulin Now Act, which would cap the cost-sharing of insulin to $35 or 25% of the negotiated price (whichever is lower) for private insurance and $35 for Medicare.


=== 2020 presidential election ===
Bentz joined the Republican members of Congress who sided with the Trump campaign's attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election. He voted not to certify Pennsylvania's electoral votes.


=== LGBTQ+ rights ===
On July 19, 2022, Bentz joined 46 other House Republicans in voting for the Respect for Marriage Act, which would repeal the Defense of Marriage Act and require each state, as well as the federal government, to recognize any marriage performed in another state. However, Bentz voted against final passage on December 8, 2022.


=== Israel ===
Bentz voted to provide Israel with support following 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.

Brian Kevin Fitzpatrick (born December 17, 1973) is an American politician, attorney, and former FBI agent who has served as a U.S. representative from Pennsylvania since 2017. His district, which was numbered the 8th district during his first term and the 1st district since 2019, includes all of Bucks County, a mostly suburban county north of Philadelphia, as well as a sliver of Montgomery County.
A Moderate Republican, Fitzpatrick was elected in 2016. After a court-mandated redistricting of Pennsylvania's congressional districts in 2018, Fitzpatrick has since been reelected to the redrawn 1st district.  He won re-election to a fifth term in 2024.
Fitzpatrick represents the wealthiest congressional district in the state of Pennsylvania.


== Early life and education ==
Born in Philadelphia and raised in nearby Levittown, Pennsylvania, Fitzpatrick graduated from Bishop Egan High School in Fairless Hills in 1992. He graduated from La Salle University in 1996 with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration. In 2001, Fitzpatrick completed both a Master of Business Administration at Pennsylvania State University and a Juris Doctor at the Penn State Dickinson School of Law.


== Career ==
Fitzpatrick is a former special assistant United States attorney and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) supervisory special agent in California. At the FBI, he served as a national supervisor for the Bureau's Public Corruption Unit, and led the agency's Campaign Finance and Election Crimes Enforcement program. During his time in the FBI, he spent time in Kyiv, Ukraine; Mosul, Iraq; and Washington, D.C. He was embedded with U.S. Special Forces as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 2016 ====

In 2016, Fitzpatrick ran for the open U.S. House seat of his brother Mike Fitzpatrick, who retired from Congress to uphold a promise to limit himself to four terms.
In the April 26, 2016, Republican primary, Fitzpatrick received 78.4% of the vote, defeating Andy Warren and Marc Duome. State representative Steve Santarsiero defeated Shaughnessy Naughton for the Democratic nomination, 59.8% to 40.2%. Fitzpatrick won the general election with 54.4% of the vote to Santarsiero's 45.6%.


==== 2018 ====

After a court-ordered redistricting, Fitzpatrick's district was renumbered the 1st district. It remained largely unchanged from the old 8th, but absorbed a larger slice of central Montgomery County. According to Nate Cohn of The New York Times, "the old 8th had been one of the more regularly drawn districts in a map that had been thrown out as an unconstitutional partisan Republican gerrymander. The new 1st was slightly more Democratic than its predecessor. Had it existed in 2016, Hillary Clinton would have carried it with 49% of the vote to Donald Trump's 47%. In contrast, Clinton and Trump finished almost tied in the old 8th, with Trump winning by 0.2 percentage points."
In the Republican primary on May 15, 2018, Fitzpatrick defeated Dean Malik, 68.85% to 31.15%. Scott Wallace, the director of a charitable foundation, won the Democratic primary with 55.97% of the vote. In the general election, Fitzpatrick defeated Wallace, 51.3% to 48.7%. He carried Bucks County by 12,000 votes, more than his overall margin of 8,300 votes. Fitzpatrick thus became one of only three Republican U.S. representatives to survive during the 2018 U.S. House elections in congressional districts that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton carried in 2016, along with John Katko and Will Hurd.


==== 2020 ====
Fitzpatrick ran for a third term in 2020. In the Republican primary, he defeated Andrew Meehan, who ran as a more conservative candidate and a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump. The Democratic nominee was Ivyland City councilwoman Christina Finello. Fitzpatrick was considered potentially vulnerable because his district had voted for Clinton in 2016, but he was reelected by a margin of 13 percentage points even as Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden won Pennsylvania and carried the district by 6 points. He was one of nine House Republicans to win in a district carried by Biden.


==== 2022 ====

In 2022, Fitzpatrick defeated Alex Entin in the Republican primary. In the general election, Fitzpatrick defeated Democratic candidate Ashley Ehasz.


==== 2024 ====

In 2024, Fitzpatrick defeated Mark Houck in the Republican primary. Fitzpatrick defeated Ashley Ehasz in the general election in 2024.
He is one of three Republicans to represent a district that 2024 Democratic Presidential Nominee Kamala Harris would have won.  


=== Tenure ===
In the 115th United States Congress, Fitzpatrick was ranked the second most bipartisan member of the House of Representatives by the Bipartisan Index, a metric created by the Lugar Center and Georgetown's McCourt School of Public Policy to assess congressional bipartisanship. In the 116th United States Congress, 117th Congress, and first session of the 118th Congress, Fitzpatrick was ranked first by the Bipartisan Index. For the first session of the 117th Congress, GovTrack noted that Fitzpatrick ranked in the 61st percentile for the most bills introduced. Additionally, they noted that he cosponsored the second most bills compared to all House Representatives at 1333, and that of these, 80% were introduced by a non-Republican legislator; joining bipartisan bills the most out of all Representatives.
Fitzpatrick voted in line with Joe Biden's stated position 70% of the time during the 117th Congress, the highest rate of any member in the Republican conference.
On February 4, 2021, Fitzpatrick joined 10 other Republican House members voting with all voting Democrats to strip Marjorie Taylor Greene of her Education and Labor Committee and Budget Committee assignments in response to controversial political statements she had made. On November 5, 2021, Fitzpatrick was among the 13 House Republicans who broke with their party and voted with a majority of Democrats for the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, a $1.2 trillion infrastructure spending bill.
Fitzpatrick was the primary sponsor of three bills that Congress enacted.


==== Abortion ====
Fitzpatrick has often but not always aligned with anti-abortion stances. While abortion is not mentioned on his website, he co-signed a letter to President Donald Trump in 2019 that requested Trump veto any efforts to weaken anti-abortion policies. In 2017, he voted for the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would prohibit abortions performed after 20 weeks of pregnancy, except in situations of incest or rape. Fitzpatrick voted against the Women's Health Protection Act of 2021, which aimed to protect health-care professionals by establishing a statutory right for them to provide abortions.
After the U.S. Supreme Court decided Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, allowing states to ban abortion, Fitzpatrick said in a statement to state legislatures, "Any legislative consideration must always seek to achieve bipartisan consensus that both respects a woman’s privacy and autonomy, and also respects the sanctity of human life. These principles are not mutually exclusive; both can and must be achieved."
Fitzpatrick was one of three Republicans to vote for H.R. 8297: Ensuring Access to Abortion Act of 2022.
Fitzpatrick also voted for H.R. 8373: The Right to Contraception Act. This bill was designed "to protect a person’s ability to access contraceptives and to engage in contraception, and to protect a health care provider’s ability to provide contraceptives, contraception, and information related to contraception".
Animal welfare
With U.S. representatives Earl Blumenauer (D-OR) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Fitzpatrick introduced the Captive Primate Safety Act in 2024, which would prohibit the private ownership of chimpanzees and other primates as pets. This proposed legislation was endorsed by law enforcement associations and animal welfare.


==== Antitrust ====
In 2022, Fitzpatrick was one of 39 Republicans to vote for the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act of 2022, an antitrust package that would crack down on corporations for anti-competitive behavior.


==== Climate change ====
At a September 2018 forum hosted by the Bipartisan Policy Center and The Hill, Fitzpatrick highlighted man-made climate change as a serious issue, saying that Republicans must "acknowledge reality and [not] deny it." He is a member of the bipartisan congressional Climate Solutions Caucus and cointroduced the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act of 2018, which would impose a carbon tax with net revenue returned to households as a rebate. He did not sponsor the 2019 version of the bill.
In March 2023, Fitzpatrick was the only Republican House member to vote against H.R. 1, Lower Energy Costs Act, which passed the House by a vote of 225–204, with four Democrats voting for it. Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer said the bill was "a giveaway to Big Oil pretending to be an energy package" and would roll back regulations for fossil fuel production.
As of 2022, Fitzpatrick has a lifetime score of 74% on the National Environmental Scorecard of the League of Conservation Voters, and is ranked as the most environmentally friendly Republican member of the House, rating higher than three Democrats.


==== Foreign policy ====
In March 2024, Fitzpatrick filed a discharge petition for the bipartisan Defending Borders, Defending Democracies Act, which would have granted 47.7 billion dollars to Ukraine, 10.4 billion dollars to Israel, and 4.9 billion dollars to the United States's Indo-Pacific allies, while also limiting federal funding for the transfer of migrants and require asylum seekers remain in Mexico awaiting their court dates.


==== Gerrymandering ====
In September 2017, Fitzpatrick urged the U.S. Supreme Court to limit extreme partisan gerrymandering in Gill v. Whitford. He stressed that partisan redistricting had undermined the Founding Fathers' vision of the House of Representatives as the voice of the people.
Fitzpatrick was the only Republican member of Congress from Pennsylvania not to take part in a February 2018 lawsuit challenging a new district map drawn by Democrats. He explained that he opposes the drawing of congressional districts by elected officials of either party, saying instead that they should be drawn by independent, nonpartisan citizen panels.


==== Gun policy ====
In 2018, Fitzpatrick was the only Republican endorsed by the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, the gun control organization founded by former U.S. representative Gabby Giffords. He voted to expand background checks and restrict assault weapon sales. He voted against a bill that would require states to recognize concealed-carry permits issued by other states.
In March 2021, Fitzpatrick was one of eight Republicans to join the House majority in passing the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021.
On July 29, 2022, Fitzpatrick and one other Republican, Chris Jacobs, joined the Democrats in voting for a bill banning assault weapons.
In the 2022 midterm elections, Fitzpatrick was the only Republican member of Congress to receive an "F" rating from the NRA Political Victory Fund.
On June 13, 2023, Fitzpatrick and one other Republican, Thomas Kean Jr. of New Jersey voted with Democrats against HJ 44, a bill repealing the ATF's new regulations on Pistol Braces.


==== Health care ====
Fitzpatrick opposed the American Health Care Act, a bill to repeal and replace the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. In a statement, he said, "After considering the current healthcare bill in a thorough and deliberate manner, I have concluded that, although the American Health Care Act focuses on several much-needed reforms to our healthcare system, in its current form I cannot support this legislation". Fitzpatrick joined many of his Republican colleagues as well as every congressional Democrat in opposing the bill.
On May 4, 2017, Fitzpatrick also voted against the second attempt to pass the American Health Care Act. In a statement, he said, "We saw what happened when healthcare reform – an issue impacting 1/5 of our economy – was rushed through Congress along extremely partisan lines in 2009," referring to the ACA in 2010. On December 12, he took part in the Democratic bill to lower drug costs, the Elijah Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act.


==== Immigration ====
In 2017, Fitzpatrick was critical of President Obama's executive order establishing the DACA program, but said the immigration system was broken. In a 2018 debate, he said he supported a path to citizenship for DREAMers, but that "any immigration reform package has to deal with border security." In 2019, he voted for the American Dream and Promise Act, which included no new border security measures.
Fitzpatrick opposed Trump's 2017 executive order to impose a temporary ban on entry to the U.S. to citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, saying, "the president's policy entirely misses the mark."


==== Israel ====
Fitzpatrick voted to provide Israel with support following 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.


==== LGBT rights ====
Fitzpatrick supports same-sex marriage. In 2019, he co-sponsored and voted for the Equality Act, which would extend anti-discrimination protections to LGBT adults and minors; seven other House Republicans joined him in voting for it and it passed the House 236–173. He was one of three Republicans to vote for it in 2021 when it again passed the House.
In 2022, Fitzpatrick was one of six Republicans to vote for the Global Respect Act, which sanctions foreign persons responsible for violations of internationally recognized human rights against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI) individuals, and for other purposes.
On July 19, 2022, Fitzpatrick and 46 other Republican representatives voted for the Respect for Marriage Act, which would codify the right to same-sex marriage in federal law.


==== Narcotics trafficking ====
Fitzpatrick sponsored the International Narcotics Trafficking Emergency Response by Detecting Incoming Contraband with Technology (INTERDICT) Act, which Trump signed into law in January 2018. The law directs $15 million to U.S. Customs and Border Patrol to expand screening for fentanyl and opioids at the U.S. border.


==== Donald Trump ====
During the 2016 election cycle, Fitzpatrick said he would support the presidential candidate Republican primary voters in the 8th District chose. After Donald Trump was made the nominee, Fitzpatrick reneged and said he wouldn't vote for either major party candidate. He instead wrote-in Mike Pence in 2016, but did vote for Trump in 2020.
In July 2019, Fitzpatrick was one of four Republican House members who voted to condemn inflammatory remarks that Trump had made about the Squad, a group of Democratic U.S. Representatives, all of whom were women of color. Trump had tweeted about the group, calling on them to "go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came".
After newsite LevittownNow.com obtained audio of Trump endorsing Fitzpatrick's 2020 re-election, Fitzpatrick's office removed the publication from its press release list, and Fitzpatrick himself also neglected to participate in a pre-primary interview with LevittownNow in 2022.
Fitzpatrick voted against both of Trump's impeachments in 2019 and 2021. Before the second impeachment vote, he introduced a censure resolution against Trump that condemned the rhetoric that led to the January 6 Capitol attack.
On May 19, 2021, Fitzpatrick was one of 35 Republicans to join all Democrats in voting to approve legislation to establish the January 6 commission meant to investigate the storming of the U.S. Capitol. He was reportedly the only House Republican to attend a 2023 ceremony marking the second anniversary of the Capitol attack. Fitzpatrick called the attack a "terrible day that we can never let happen again".


==== Russia ====
In a 2018 debate, Fitzpatrick said that Russia held "by and large sinister motives", noting that while he was stationed in Ukraine, Russia twice attempted to knock out Ukraine's electrical grids through cyber attacks.
In July 2018, Fitzpatrick said that Russian leader Vladimir Putin had "manipulated" Trump at the Helsinki Summit. Fitzpatrick said he was "frankly sickened by the exchange" between Trump and Putin. He criticized the "mixed signals" that the Trump administration was sending regarding Russian interference in the 2016 election.
In April 2018, Fitzpatrick said that Trump should stop attacking the FBI and allow Robert Mueller to complete his investigation, saying it was improper to "judge an institution based on the actions of a few bad actors".


==== Taxes ====
In December 2017, Fitzpatrick voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in a party-line vote.


==== Term limits and congressional perks ====
In April 2018, Fitzpatrick led a bipartisan group of freshmen House members in an Oval Office meeting at which they discussed with Trump a proposed constitutional amendment imposing congressional term limits.
In May 2018, Fitzpatrick and Stephanie Murphy introduced H.R. 5946, the Fostering Accountability, Integrity, Trust, and Honor (FAITH) in Congress Act, which would "end certain special perks reserved for Members of Congress, enact a lifetime ban preventing former Members of Congress from becoming lobbyists, and withhold Members' paychecks if they fail to pass a budget on time".


==== Steve Bannon ====
On October 21, 2021, Fitzpatrick was one of nine House Republicans to vote to hold Steve Bannon in contempt of Congress.


==== 2024 presidential election ====

Scott Gordon Perry (born May 27, 1962) is an American politician and retired Army National Guard brigadier general who is the U.S. representative for Pennsylvania's 10th congressional district, serving since 2013. The district, numbered as Pennsylvania's 4th congressional district from 2013 to 2019, is centered around Harrisburg, York, and most of their inner suburbs in Dauphin, Cumberland, and York counties. Perry is a member of the Republican Party.
In November 2021 Perry was elected chair of the House Freedom Caucus, the most conservative House Republican group, and served through 2023.
Perry participated in attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election, including by attempting to replace Pennsylvania's slate of electors.


== Early life and education ==
Scott Gordon Perry was born in San Diego, California, to Cecile Lenig and Jim Perry. Scott's grandparents were Colombian immigrants. His mother was a flight attendant and left an abusive relationship with his father after he was born. She moved with him and his brother to south-central Pennsylvania, when he was seven. After losing her flight attendant job, she worked for a wholesale food company. The family lived first in Harrisburg and then soon afterwards moved to Dillsburg.
Perry and his family were on public assistance for several years during his youth. He was raised in a simple home that initially had no electricity and plumbing, pumping water from a well and cutting firewood with his older brother in the winter. When he was eleven years old, his mother married his step father, Daniel Chimel, who was an airplane pilot and air traffic controller.
In 1980, Perry graduated from Northern High School in Dillsburg and Cumberland-Perry Vo-Tech School in Cumberland County, Pennsylvania. He put himself through college while working full-time, earned his associate's degree from Harrisburg Area Community College, and graduated from Pennsylvania State University with a B.S. in business administration and management in 1991. In 2012, he received a master's degree in strategic planning from the United States Army War College.
Perry began working at age 13, picking fruit at Ashcombe's Farm in Mechanicsburg. Since then, he has worked as a mechanic, dock worker, draftsman and a licensed insurance agent, among other jobs.


== Military service ==


=== Army National Guard ===
Perry enlisted in the Pennsylvania Army National Guard in 1980. He attended basic training at Fort Dix, New Jersey, and graduated from Advanced Individual Training at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, as a technical drafting specialist. He graduated from Pennsylvania's Officer Candidate School and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Field Artillery.
After receiving his commission, Perry qualified as a helicopter pilot in the United States Army Aviation Branch, where he earned qualifications in numerous aircraft (Huey, Cayuse, Kiowa, Cobra, Chinook, Apache, and Blackhawk) and an Instructor Pilot rating. He commanded military units at the company, battalion and brigade levels and served in a variety of staff assignments as he advanced through the ranks, including executive officer of 1st Squadron, 104th Cavalry Regiment during deployment to Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2002–03, and commander of 2nd Battalion (General Support), 104th Aviation Regiment beginning in 2008.


=== Iraq War ===
In 2009–2010, Perry commanded 2nd Battalion, 104th Aviation Regiment during its service in Iraq for Operation Iraqi Freedom. As Task Force Diablo, 2-104th Aviation was credited with flying 1,400 missions, accruing over 10,000 combat flight hours, and transporting over 3 million pounds of cargo and 50,000 soldiers and civilians. Perry flew 44 combat missions in Iraq, and accrued nearly 200 combat flight hours. On Thanksgiving Day 2009, Perry and some of his soldiers participated in a race around the airfield at Camp Adder.


=== Post-Iraq ===

After returning from Iraq, Perry was promoted to colonel and assigned to command the Pennsylvania National Guard's 166th Regiment (Regional Training Institute). From 2012 to 2014, he commanded the garrison at the Fort Indiantown Gap National Training Center. In May 2014, Perry was assigned as assistant division commander of the 28th Infantry Division and promoted to brigadier general in November 2015. In May 2016, he was selected as assistant adjutant general at the Pennsylvania National Guard's Joint Force Headquarters. Perry retired from the Pennsylvania National Guard on March 1, 2019.


== Business career ==
After graduating from college, Perry co-founded mechanical contracting business Hydrotech Mechanical Services. In 2002, Perry was charged with falsifying reports to the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). The reports regarded levels of chlorine and acidity at a sewage plant. He completed the state's Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition program and the company was fined $5,000.  Perry says he learned of problems at the sewage plant and reported the problems to the DEP; he said "I saw something going on that I thought was wrong, and as bureaucrats often do, they pursued me in that regard."


== Government service ==
Before entering politics, Perry chaired the Carroll Township Planning Commission, and was a member of the Township Source Water Protection Committee. He chaired the Dillsburg Area Wellhead Protection Advisory Committee and served on the Dillsburg Revitalization Committee. He remains a member of the Jaycees and held the office of regional director for the state organization.

== Pennsylvania House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===
In 2006, state representative Bruce Smith of Pennsylvania's 92nd House district decided to retire. Perry won the Republican primary with 41% of the vote. He won the general election with 71% of the vote, and took office on January 2, 2007. In 2008, Perry was reelected to a second term unopposed. In 2010, he was reelected to a third term unopposed.


=== Committee assignments ===


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 2012 ====

In 2012, Perry gave up his state house seat to run for the 4th congressional district. The district had previously been the 19th district, represented by six-term incumbent Republican Todd Platts, who was giving up the seat to honor a self-imposed term limit. In 2010, when Platts wanted to become U.S. comptroller general, he spoke to Perry about running for the seat.
Perry won a seven-way primary with over 50% of the vote. Although outspent nearly 2 to 1 in the campaign, he beat his closest competitor with nearly three times as many votes. Political newcomer Harry Perkinson, an engineer, advanced in a two-way Democratic primary. Perry won the general election, 60%–34%.


==== 2014 ====

In 2014, Perry was unopposed in the Republican primary and the former Harrisburg mayor, Linda D. Thompson, was unopposed in the Democratic primary. Perry won the general election, 75%–25%.


==== 2016 ====

Perry won the 2016 election with no primary challenge and no official Democratic opponent. Joshua Burkholder of Harrisburg, a political novice, withdrew from the Democratic primary after too many signatures on his qualifying petition were successfully challenged. His subsequent write-in candidacy won the Democratic primary, but he was unaffiliated in the general election. Perry defeated Burkholder, 66%–34%.


==== 2018 ====

After ruling the state's congressional map an unconstitutional gerrymander, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court issued a new map for the 2018 elections. Perry's district was renumbered the 10th and made significantly more compact than its predecessor. It lost most of the more rural and Republican areas of York County to the neighboring 11th district (the old 16th). To make up for the loss in population, it was pushed slightly to the north, absorbing the remainder of Democratic-leaning Dauphin County that had not been in the old 4th. On paper, the new district was less Republican than its predecessor. Had the district existed in 2016, Donald Trump would have won it with 52% of the vote to Hillary Clinton's 43%; Trump carried the old 4th with 58% of the vote.
Pastor and Army veteran George Scott won the Democratic primary by a narrow margin and opposed Perry in the general election for the reconfigured 10th. The two debated in October before Perry won with 51.3% of the vote to Scott's 48.7%, with the new district boundaries taking effect in 2019. Perry held on by winning the district's share of his home county, York County, by 11,600 votes.


==== 2020 ====

In 2020, Perry had no Republican primary challenger, and the Pennsylvania auditor general, Eugene DePasquale, won a two-way Democratic primary. Perry was reelected with 53.3% of the vote in the general election.


==== 2022 ====

In 2022, Perry defeated Democratic nominee Shamaine Daniels with 54% of the vote.


==== 2024 ====

On January 2, 2024, a lawsuit seeking to bar Perry from the 2024 ballot via Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution was filed by Democratic activist Gene Stilp. The suit was withdrawn after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in March that only Congress can disqualify federal candidates. Perry faced Democratic nominee Janelle Stelson in the general election. The race was closely watched because it took place in a swing district in a swing state. Perry ultimately defeated Stelson with 50.8% of the vote.


=== Tenure ===
Perry is a member of the Freedom Caucus. In November 2021, he was elected to chair the group, succeeding Andy Biggs in January 2022; Bob Good succeeded Perry as chair in January 2024.
In October 2017, in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, Perry accused CNN anchor Chris Cuomo of exaggerating the crisis in Puerto Rico.
In January 2018, Perry suggested that ISIS might have been involved in the 2017 Las Vegas shooting. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack, but authorities have maintained that gunman Stephen Paddock acted alone.
In December 2019, Perry was one of 195 Republicans to vote against both articles of impeachment against President Trump.
In October 2020, Perry was one of 17 Republicans to vote against a House resolution to formally condemn the QAnon conspiracy theory. He said he voted against the resolution because he was concerned about infringements on free speech, saying, "it's very dangerous for the government ... to determine what is okay to like and what is not okay to like."
Perry participated in attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election, including by attempting to replace Pennsylvania's electors. The House committee investigating the January 6 Capitol attack called for an interview with Perry, the first time it publicly sought to question a sitting member of Congress. Perry declined the request the next day. The panel's chairperson said it had evidence from several witnesses that Perry had "an important role" in efforts to install Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Clark as acting attorney general as part of attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election. According to the committee, Perry introduced President Donald Trump to environmental lawyer Jeffrey Clark. The committee subpoenaed Perry on May 12, 2022, and Perry declined to participate, citing legal authority. After the November 2022 elections, the committee referred Perry to the House Ethics Panel for refusing their subpoena; it is unclear whether the panel will support any action.
In March 2021, Perry voted against the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. He said only 9% of the act's spending was allotted to defeat the COVID-19 virus, while the rest would advance Democratic policies.
In April 2021, at a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee meeting on immigration, days after Fox News host Tucker Carlson promoted the Great Replacement theory, Perry said, "For many Americans, what seems to be happening or what they believe right now is happening is, what appears to them is we're replacing national-born American—native-born Americans to permanently transform the political landscape of this very nation."
In June 2021, Perry was one of 21 House Republicans to vote against a resolution to give the Congressional Gold Medal to police officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on January 6. He cosponsored a bill, introduced the same day, that would give the same medal to police officers without mentioning the attack.
At the June 2021 Republican Pennsylvania Leadership Conference, Perry said Democrats "are not the loyal opposition. They are the opposition to everything you love and believe in" and "want to destroy the country you grew up in", invoking comparisons to Nazis.
In July 2022, Perry was among 47 House Republicans to vote for the Respect for Marriage Act, which would repeal the Defense of Marriage Act and protect the right to same-sex marriage at a federal level. Perry said, "Agree or disagree with same-sex marriage, my vote affirmed my long-held belief that Americans who enter into legal agreements deserve to live their lives without the threat that our federal government will dissolve what they've built." In December 2022, Perry voted against the final version of the bill. He said his initial "yes" vote was a mistake based on a lack of time to review the legislation.
In May 2024, CNN obtained a recording in which Perry told a closed door briefing of the House Oversight Committee that Ku Klux Klan is "the military wing of the Democratic party" and that migrants coming to the U.S. "have no interest in being Americans." Perry said "Replacement theory is real. They added white to it to stop everybody from talking about it," in reference to the Great Replacement conspiracy theory in the United States.


==== Foreign policy ====
In March 2021, Perry was one of 14 House Republicans to vote against a measure condemning the Myanmar coup d'état that overwhelmingly passed.
In July 2021, Perry voted against the bipartisan ALLIES Act, which would increase by 8,000 the number of special immigrant visas for Afghan allies of the U.S. military during its invasion of Afghanistan while also reducing some application requirements that caused long application backlogs; the bill passed in the House 407–16.
In April 2022, Perry voted against a bill to encourage documentation and preservation of Russian war crimes during its invasion of Ukraine.
In 2023, Perry was among 47 Republicans to vote in favor of H.Con.Res. 21, which directed President Joe Biden to remove U.S. troops from Syria within 180 days.
In 2024, Perry voted against two multi-billion dollar foreign aid packages which included money for Taiwan, Ukraine, and Israel. Perry opposed House speaker Mike Johnson's tactic of bundling aid bills, saying he preferred single subject bills. Perry also objected to $9 billion in humanitarian aid for Gaza, citing the Israeli government's claim that Hamas has been stealing aid intended for Gaza's civilians.


==== Climate change ====
Perry frequently opposes proposed climate change policies in Congress, including policies which have support within the GOP. During 2023 testimony before the Foreign Affairs committee by the U.S. special presidential envoy for climate, Perry presented charts that he said showed climate change had stopped since 2016. This position is sharply at odds with the scientific consensus on climate change.


==== Abortion policy ====
Perry opposes a federal abortion ban. He has "repeatedly stated his support for IVF, and says that he maintains his personal pro-life stance while continuing to leave the issue to the states."


==== Veterans ====
The PACT ACT which expanded VA benefits to veterans exposed to toxic chemicals during their military service, received a "nay" from Perry. Regarding cannabis, despite lobbying from VSOs such as the DAV, Perry also voted against the 2022 MORE Act.

== Involvement in attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election ==
According to The Philadelphia Inquirer, Perry was "one of the leading figures in the effort to throw out Pennsylvania's votes in the 2020 presidential election."
After the election, Perry promoted claims of election fraud. Days after the election, in text messages to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, Perry suggested John Ratcliffe should direct the National Security Agency to investigate alleged Chinese hacking. Perry also asserted "the Brits" were behind a conspiracy to manipulate voting machines and that CIA director Gina Haspel was covering it up. The next month, he sent Meadows a link to a YouTube video that asserted voting machines had been manipulated via satellite from Italy; Meadows later sent the video to former Acting Attorney General Richard Donoghue, seeking an investigation. Donoghue told the committee the contentions in the video, originating from QAnon and far-right platforms which had been brought to the White House, were "pure insanity."
Perry was one of 126 Republican House members to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated Trump.
Perry reportedly played a key role in a December 2020 crisis at the Justice Department, in which Trump considered firing Acting Attorney General Jeffrey A. Rosen and replacing him with Jeffrey Clark, the acting chief of the Civil Division of the DOJ. According to The Los Angeles Times, Perry "prompted" Trump to consider the replacement. The New York Times reported that Perry introduced Clark to Trump because Clark's "openness to conspiracy theories about election fraud presented Mr. Trump with a welcome change from Rosen, who stood by the results of the election and had repeatedly resisted the president's efforts to undo them."
Before the certification of the electoral college vote on January 6, Perry and Clark reportedly discussed a plan in which the Justice Department would send Georgia legislators a letter suggesting the DOJ had evidence of voter fraud and suggesting the legislators invalidate Georgia's electoral votes, even though the DOJ had investigated reports of fraud but found nothing significant, as attorney general Bill Barr had publicly announced weeks earlier. Clark drafted a letter to Georgia officials and presented it to Rosen and his deputy Donoghue. It claimed the DOJ had "identified significant concerns that may have impacted the outcome of the election in multiple States" and urged the Georgia legislature to convene a special session for the "purpose of considering issues pertaining to the appointment of Presidential Electors." Rosen and Donoghue rejected the proposal.
In August 2021, CNN reported that Ratcliffe had briefed top Justice Department officials that no evidence had been found of any foreign powers' interference with voting machines. Clark was reportedly concerned that intelligence community analysts were withholding information and believed Perry and others knew more about possible foreign interference. Clark requested authorization from Rosen and Donoghue for another briefing from Ratcliffe, asserting hackers had found that "a Dominion machine accessed the Internet through a smart thermostat with a net connection trail leading back to China."
On January 6, 2021, Perry joined Missouri senator Josh Hawley in objecting to counting Pennsylvania's electoral votes in the 2020 presidential election. During the storming of the U.S. Capitol that day, Perry and his congressional colleagues were ushered to a secure location.
On December 20, 2021, House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack chairman Bennie Thompson wrote to Perry asking him to provide information about his involvement in the effort to install Clark as acting attorney general. Thompson believed Perry had been involved in the effort to install Clark, given previous testimony from Rosen and Donoghue, as well as communications between Perry and Meadows. Perry declined the request the next day, asserting the committee was illegitimate. Among several text messages to Meadows the committee released on December 14 was one attributed to a "member of Congress" dated January 5 that read "Please check your signal", a reference to the encrypted messaging system Signal. In his letter to Perry, Thompson mentioned evidence that Perry had communicated with Meadows using Signal, though Perry denied sending that particular text message. CNN acquired and published additional Meadows text messages in April 2022 that confirmed Perry had sent that message.
On June 9, 2022, Select Committee member Liz Cheney asserted that Perry requested a presidential pardon from Trump in the weeks after the January 6 attack. Perry denied Cheney's assertion, calling it "an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie". On June 23, 2022, the Select Committee broadcast testimony from Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to Meadows, who said Perry was one of several lawmakers who contacted her to "inquire about preemptive pardons." In response, Perry said he had never spoken with any White House staff about a pardon for him or any other members of Congress.
In August 2022, Perry reported that three FBI agents had seized his cellphone after presenting him with a warrant. He called the seizure an "unnecessary and aggressive action". Perry asked Chief Judge of the D.C. District Court Beryl Howell to prevent investigators from accessing 2,219 documents stored on his phone, citing the Speech or Debate Clause of the U.S. Constitution. On February 24, 2023, Howell unsealed her December 2022 ruling that found Perry had an "astonishing view" of his immunity, ordering him to disclose 2,055 messages, including all 960 of his contacts with members of the executive branch. The ruling was appealed to a three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which in September 2023 directed Howell's successor Jeb Boasberg to scrutinize all 2,055 messages; he ruled in December 2023 that investigators could see 1,659 messages and Perry could withhold 396 others.

Lloyd Kenneth Smucker (born January 23, 1964) is an American politician serving as the U.S. representative from Pennsylvania's 11th congressional district, which includes Lancaster County and most of southern York County. He is a member of the Republican Party and represented the 16th district until the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania redrew it in 2018 due to gerrymandering. He was a member of the Pennsylvania State Senate for the 13th district from 2009 to 2016.


== Biography ==
Smucker was born in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, to Daniel and Arie Smucker. At the time of his birth, the family belonged to the Old Order Amish, but they left the community when he was five years old. After graduating from Lancaster Mennonite High School in 1981, he attended Lebanon Valley College and Franklin & Marshall College, where he earned credits in liberal arts but did not complete a degree. For 25 years, he served as president of the Smucker Company, a family-owned commercial construction firm in Smoketown that received $4.83 million in PPP loans in 2020 and 2021 that were subsequently forgiven. Smucker is a Lutheran and has three children with his wife, Cindy.


== Pennsylvania Senate ==
Smucker was a member of the West Lampeter Township Planning Commission for four years before serving two terms as a township supervisor. In 2008, after 23-year incumbent Gib Armstrong decided to retire, Smucker entered the four-way Republican primary to succeed him, receiving 47% of the vote. In the general election, he defeated the Democratic nominee, Lancaster City Council member José E. Urdaneta, 57%-43%.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===

On November 8, 2016, Smucker defeated Christina Hartman with 53% of the vote in the race to replace the retiring Joe Pitts in Congress. He was sworn in to represent Pennsylvania's 16th congressional district on January 3, 2017.
A new congressional map imposed by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court renumbered Smucker's district as the 11th district. It picked up the sliver of Lancaster County that had previously been in the 7th district, while losing its shares of Chester and Berks counties. To make up for the loss in population, it was shifted to the west, absorbing most of the more rural eastern portion of York County. The old 16th had been one of Pennsylvania's most Republican districts, but the Democratic trend in areas of the district closer to Philadelphia had resulted in close races at the presidential level since the turn of the millennium. John McCain only carried the old 16th with 51% of the vote in 2008, while Mitt Romney won it with 52% in 2012 and Donald Trump won it with 51% in 2016. According to Nate Cohn of The New York Times, these trends theoretically left Smucker vulnerable in a Democratic wave.
In contrast, the new 11th is significantly more rural and Republican than its predecessor. Had it existed in 2016, Trump would have won it with over 60% of the vote, which would have been his fifth-best showing in the state. According to Cohn, the Republican-controlled state legislature had placed the more Democratic areas of Chester and Berks counties into the 16th in order to protect Republican incumbents in neighboring districts. As Cohn put it, the loss of those areas and the addition of part of York County had the effect of making what was already a "naturally Republican" district even more so.
As expected, Smucker won a second term handily, defeating Democratic nominee Jess King with 59% of the vote.


=== Tenure ===
During the presidency of Donald Trump, Smucker voted in line with Trump's stated position 94% of the time. As of September 2021, Smucker had voted in line with Joe Biden's stated position 14.3% of the time.
Smucker supported the American Health Care Act, the GOP's legislation to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).
On September 24, 2014, Smucker voted against Pennsylvania senate bill SB1182, which would legalize medical cannabis in Pennsylvania. He voted to repeal provisions in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. He has voted for increases in military spending. He supported legislation to punish sanctuary cities. In 2017, Smucker voted for a budget that proposed cutting Medicare by $537 billion and giving seniors the opportunity to enroll in private plans in competition with Medicare.
On January 6, 2021, Smucker voted to overturn the Electoral College results that would make Biden president. Pennsylvania cast its electoral ballots for Biden in the 2020 presidential election.

At Duquesne, Reschenthaler founded the Military Law Society chapter and interned at the U.S. District Attorney's Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania in Pittsburgh.


== Military career ==
After law school, Reschenthaler was commissioned in the United States Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps (JAG). In the U.S. Navy, Reschenthaler deployed to Baghdad, Iraq, in 2009. In 2010, he was one of three attorneys who defended a Navy SEAL accused of covering up an assault on terrorist Ahmad Hashim Abd al-Isawi while al-Isawi was in custody. The Navy SEAL represented by Reschenthaler and the other SEALs charged were acquitted of all charges. Reschenthaler was awarded the Michael Taylor Shelby Award for Professionalism, Ethics and Dedication in the practice of law. He left military service in 2012.


== Legal career ==
After leaving the Navy, Reschenthaler returned to Pittsburgh to practice law in spring 2012 before being elected magisterial district judge in Pittsburgh's South Hills in 2013. In Pennsylvania, magisterial judges typically handle traffic tickets. He was elected district judge in May 2013. As a magistrate, Reschenthaler said that he would seek to reduce truancy.
In 2013, Reschenthaler briefly co-hosted a radio program with Carl Higbie. Reschenthaler had heated debates with Higbie on the show, with CNN reporting that, "In one episode in March 2013, after Higbie repeatedly argued that 'the black race' was 'lazier than the white race,' Reschenthaler became audibly upset at his co-host. The congressional candidate said that he was 'turning red' and 'feeling uncomfortable' listening to Higbie’s rant, which he called 'insane' and 'so off-base.'"
Reschenthaler also wrote the foreword to a 2012 self-published book by Higbie. In April 2018, Reschenthaler denounced the book and disavowed the foreword he had written. He said he had only read parts of the book.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 2018 special ====

In October 2017, Reschenthaler announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination in the special election in Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district. At the Republican Party conference, he lost to State Representative Rick Saccone. He received 75 votes from local activists and failed to gain a majority in the first round of voting. He was defeated by 32 votes in the second round.


==== 2018 general ====

After a court threw out Pennsylvania's congressional map as an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander, the 18th district was renumbered the 14th and made even more Republican on paper. Democrat Conor Lamb defeated Saccone in the special election for the old 18th, but had his home drawn into the neighboring 17th district (the former 12th district) and sought a full term there.
Reschenthaler ran in the Republican primary for the reconfigured 14th, again facing Saccone. This time, he won the nomination with 55.4% of the vote to Saccone's 44.6%. In the general election, he defeated the Democratic nominee, businesswoman Bibiana Boerio, with 58% of the vote.


==== 2020 general ====

Reschenthaler ran for reelection. He defeated the Democratic nominee, U.S. Marine Corps veteran William Marx, with 64.7% of the vote.
On December 31, 2020, Reschenthaler and seven other Republican U.S. representatives from Pennsylvania said they would oppose the certification of Pennsylvania's electors when Congress met to count electoral votes in the 2020 presidential election on January 6, 2021. The eight claimed that state officials had illegally allowed the counting of mail-in ballots that were received after Election Day but postmarked by November 3. According to NBC Philadelphia news and the Pennsylvania Capital-Star, this was not proven.
Reschentaler was also among those who signed an amicus brief to a lawsuit filed by Texas's attorney general (Texas v. Pennsylvania) seeking to throw out federal election results in key swing states, including Pennsylvania.
Reschenthaler, who represents the southwest corner of Pennsylvania, was one of 147 Republican representatives and senators to vote against certifying the presidential election results.
2024 general

Reschenthaler is running for reelection against Democratic nominee Army combat veteran Chris Dziados.


=== Tenure ===
In December 2020, Reschenthaler joined other Republicans in voting against providing $2,000 stimulus checks to Americans, on grounds that such aid would further weaken the US economy.
In April 2024, Reschenthaler co-sponsored a bill to rename Dulles International Airport after former president Donald Trump. He said in an interview that there would be "no better symbol of freedom, prosperity and strength".
In May 2024, Reschenthaler co-sponsored a bill to extend US military benefits to American citizens in the Israel Defense Forces, including Servicemembers Civil Relief Act and Uniformed Services Employment and Re-employment Rights Act of 1994.


=== Political Postions ===

Glenn William "GT" Thompson Jr. (born July 27, 1959) is an American politician serving as the U.S. representative for Pennsylvania's 15th congressional district since 2019. A member of the Republican Party, he was first elected to Congress in 2008 for the state's 5th congressional district; Thompson was redistricted to the 15th congressional district in the 2018 election by an order of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. Since 2023, he has chaired the House Agriculture Committee. Thompson became the dean of the Pennsylvania's Congressional delegation in 2025 following the defeat of Senator Bob Casey Jr.


== Early life, education and early career ==

Thompson was born in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, grew up in Howard, Pennsylvania, and is the son of a Navy veteran. He holds a bachelor's degree in therapeutic recreation from Pennsylvania State University and dual master's degrees in therapeutic recreation and health science from Temple University.
Thompson worked for 28 years as a Therapist/Rehab Services Manager/Licensed Nursing Home Administrator in Lycoming County and chaired the Centre County Republican Committee for six years. He has spent 25 years as a member or president of the Howard Volunteer Fire Company 14, and volunteers as a firefighter, emergency medical technician, and rescue technician.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Tenure ===

When the 112th Congress convened on January 5, 2011, to elect a Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, Thompson's vote was the 218th vote for John Boehner, giving Boehner the majority needed to be named Speaker.
During the 112th Congress, Thompson became chairman of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Forestry, Conservation, and Energy.
At the start of the 115th Congress, Thompson was named vice-chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture. In December 2020, ahead of the 117th Congress, he was named ranking member of the agriculture committee.


==== Government funding ====
In January 2018, Thompson voted for the Fiscal Year 2018 continuing resolution (CR), a stopgap funding bill to fund the federal government at then-current levels through February 16, 2018. It also provided for six-year funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Thompson praised the measure for delaying what he called "three onerous and unpopular Obamacare taxes, which should be permanently repealed."


==== Education ====
As a member of the House Education and Workforce Committee, Thompson has supported local control rather than federal mandates on issues like evaluating teachers, opposed private school vouchers, and voted to expand S-CHIP (children's health insurance). In August 2014, the National Education Association's political action committee endorsed Thompson for reelection.


==== Food programs ====
In April 2018, Thompson supported new work and job training requirements for certain beneficiaries of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), or food stamps. Thompson spoke up for the federal Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), recalling that in the early 1980s, when he earned "less than $9,000", he and his wife had relied upon WIC, "a short-term intervention program designed to help pregnant women and their children meet healthy nutritional needs."


==== Gun control ====

After the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in 2018, Thompson told an audience of students that he did not agree with the idea of arming teachers and had voted to fund an improved national background check system. Thompson called for more "uniformed law enforcement in our schools."


==== Veterans ====
In April 2017, Thompson and Julia Brownley introduced H.R. 2123, the Veterans E-Health and Telemedicine Support (VETS) Act of 2017. In September, Thompson praised the Department of Veterans Affairs for proposing a rule that was similar to his bill that would allow VA-credentialed health care providers to practice telemedicine across state lines.
Thompson sponsored the Servicemembers' Telemedicine and E-Health Portability Act of 2011, which was enacted as part of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012. The bill expanded the use of telemedicine for active duty military, reserve and National Guard.


==== Environment ====
Of climate change, Thompson has said, "I think humans contribute," but added that he was not sure of the degree to which they contribute. In September 2017, Thompson and several other members of Congress asked the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to rescind the Waters of the United States rule, calling the regulation an overreach that expanded "EPA's authority far beyond its congressional mandate."


==== Rural air service ====
In April 2018, Thompson fought efforts to eliminate federal funding for the Essential Air Service. Three airports in his district participate in it.


==== Texas v. Pennsylvania ====
In December 2020, Thompson was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated incumbent Donald Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.


==== Marriage rights ====
In July 2022, Thompson voted against the Respect for Marriage Act, which would codify the right to same-sex marriage, just days before attending his son's same-sex wedding.


=== Committee assignments ===
Committee on Agriculture (chair)
Subcommittee on General Farm Commodities and Risk Management
Subcommittee on Biotechnology, Horticulture, and Research

George Joseph "Mike" Kelly Jr. (born May 10, 1948) is an American politician and businessman who has been a U.S. representative since 2011, currently representing Pennsylvania's 16th congressional district. The district, numbered as the 3rd district from 2011 to 2019, is based in Erie and stretches from the northwest corner of the state to the outer northern suburbs of Pittsburgh.
A member of the Republican Party, Kelly is known for his support of Donald Trump, his pro-life stance, and filing a lawsuit in state court to invalidate all mail-in ballots cast in Pennsylvania during the 2020 United States presidential election.
On October 22, 2021, it was reported that a congressional ethics watchdog had recommended subpoenaing Kelly for an ethics violation after it was revealed that his wife had purchased stock in an Ohio-based steel company in April 2020 after Kelly had received confidential information about the company. In June 2022, Senator Ron Johnson accused Kelly of providing a slate of fake electors meant to overturn Pennsylvania's electoral votes in the 2020 election. Kelly's office has denied his role in this event.


== Education and early career ==
Kelly was born on May 10, 1948, in Pittsburgh, but has spent most of his life in the outer northern suburb of Butler. He attended the University of Notre Dame.


== Automotive business ==
After college, Kelly worked for his father's Chevrolet/Cadillac car dealership. In 1995, he took over the business, and added Hyundai and KIA to its lineup.
In March 2019, a local TV station discovered that 17 vehicles were for sale on Kelly's Uniontown and Butler lots that were the subject of recall notices but had not been repaired. The station contacted both the businesses and Kelly's office without receiving responses. A month later, a reporter found three of those vehicles with active recalls still for sale. In November 2015, Kelly had spoken on the floor of Congress in support of a bill that would have allowed dealers to loan or rent vehicles despite National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) safety recall notices on them. Kelly had said, "There is not a single person in our business that would ever put one of our owners in a defective car or a car with a recall. But that could happen." The bill did not pass.
Kelly's car dealerships received Paycheck Protection Program loans of between $450,000 and $1.05 million to keep staff on the payroll during the coronavirus pandemic. The figure was later estimated to be a combined amount of $974,100. The loan program was primarily intended to protect employee pay during the COVID-19 pandemic. The loans were eventually forgiven, and Kelly was scrutinized for receiving the loan while serving as a member of Congress, though he denied any wrongdoing.


== United States House of Representatives ==


=== Committees and caucuses ===
Kelly is has served on the U.S. House of Representatives' Ways & Means Committee since 2013.[1] He currently chairs the Subcommittee on Tax and is a member of the Subcommittee on Health. He previously served as the top Republican on the Committee's Subcommittee on Oversight.
Kelly belongs to more than 20 caucuses in the U.S. House of Representatives. He chairs or co-chairs several prominent caucuses, including the following:

Congressional Cancer Caucus
Congressional Caucus on Korea
Congressional Childhood Cancer Caucus
Friends of Ireland Caucus
House Automotive Caucus
House Small Brewers Caucus
Northern Border Security Caucus


=== Elections ===


==== 2010 ====

Kelly challenged incumbent Representative Kathy Dahlkemper in 2010. He won the election by 10%, largely by running up his margins outside of heavily Democratic Erie.


==== 2012 ====

Kelly defeated Democrat Missa Eaton 55%–41%. His district had been made slightly friendlier in redistricting. The district was pushed slightly south, absorbing some rural and Republican territory east of Pittsburgh. At the same time, eastern Erie County was drawn into the heavily Republican 5th district. The 3rd and 5th were drawn so that the boundary between the two districts was almost coextensive with the eastern boundary of the city of Erie.


==== 2014 ====

Kelly defeated Democrat Dan LaVallee of Cranberry Township 60.5%–39.5%.


==== 2016 ====

Kelly ran unopposed and received 100% of the vote.


==== 2018 ====

After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court threw out Pennsylvania's original congressional map in February 2018, Kelly's district was renumbered the 16th and made slightly more compact. It regained the eastern portion of Erie County that had been drawn into the 5th. To make up for the increase in population, its southern portion was pushed to the west, leaving Kelly's hometown of Butler just barely inside the district.
PoliticsPA wrote that the new 16th was far less safe for Kelly than the old 3rd, citing a Public Policy Polling poll showing him leading Democratic nominee Ron DiNicola 48% to 43%, below the threshold to be considered safe for a fourth term. Additionally, while Trump carried the old 3rd with 61% of the vote, he would have carried the new 16th with 58% of the vote. Nate Cohn of The New York Times suggested that Kelly would have been in more danger had the 16th absorbed more Democratic-leaning territory northwest of Pittsburgh. Ultimately, much of this territory had been drawn into the reconfigured 17th district (the former 12th district).
Kelly defeated DiNicola 51.6%–47.2%, his first close contest since his initial run for the seat.


==== 2020 ====

Kelly defeated Democrat Kristy Gnibus of Erie 59.34%–40.66%, an improvement over his performance in 2018. He received 210,088 votes to Gnibus's 143,962.


==== 2022 ====

Kelly defeated Democrat Dan Pastore of Erie 59.4%–40.6%. Kelly received 190,564 votes, while Pastore received 130,443.


==== 2024 ====

Kelly defeated Democrat Preston Nouri 63.7% to 36.4%. Kelly received 256,923 votes, while Nouri received 146,709.


=== Committee assignments ===
Committee on Ways and Means
Subcommittee on Tax (Chairman)
Subcommittee on Health


=== Caucus memberships ===
Northeast-Midwest Congressional Coalition
Republican Study Committee


=== Tenure ===


==== Conservative Political Action Conference attendance ====
In February 2021, Kelly and a dozen other Republican House members skipped votes and enlisted others to vote for them, citing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. But he and the other members were actually attending the Conservative Political Action Conference, which was held at the same time as their absences. In response, the Campaign for Accountability, an ethics watchdog group, filed a complaint with the House Committee on Ethics and requested an investigation into Kelly and the other lawmakers.


==== Debt forgiveness ====
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Kelly's auto dealerships received loans from US taxpayers of over $970,000 as part of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP); the loans were later forgiven. U.S. Representative Katie Porter later introduced legislation that would require all loans under the PPP to be made public. Kelly voted against the TRUTH Act (H.R. 6782), a bill that would have required public disclosure of companies that received funds through the bailout program. As of August 2022, Kelly opposes President Joe Biden's proposal to forgive $10,000 of student debt for individuals making up to $125,000 per year. Kelly's net worth was estimated to be $12.4 million in 2018.


==== "Deep state" conspiracy theories ====
When speaking at a Mercer County Republican Party event in 2017, Kelly advanced the conspiracy theory that former president Barack Obama was running a "shadow government" to undermine President Trump. When asked about these remarks, Kelly said they were meant to be private. After the remarks made national news, Kelly's spokesperson said that Kelly did not believe that Obama "is personally operating a shadow government".


==== Donald Trump ====

Kelly has argued against the release of Trump's tax returns by the House Ways and Means Committee.
In December 2019, Kelly likened Trump's first impeachment to the Attack on Pearl Harbor. He said the date on which Trump was impeached is "another date that will live in infamy", referring to President Franklin Roosevelt's statement about the Pearl Harbor attack.
Amid ballot counting in the 2020 election, Kelly filed a lawsuit to stop Pennsylvania from allowing voters to "cure" (alter) their ballots. After Biden won Pennsylvania, Kelly filed a suit arguing that all mail-in ballots cast in the state (more than 2.5 million) should be discarded, which would result in flipping the state to Trump, or if that was not possible, that the electors for president should instead be chosen by the legislature. If successful, this suit would have invalidated millions of votes in the Pennsylvania election. On November 28, 2020, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court unanimously rejected Kelly's suit, additionally ruling to "dismiss with prejudice."
In December 2020, Kelly was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Biden defeated Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.
In July 2024, following the attempted assassination of Donald Trump in Kelly's hometown, Kelly initially released a post that stated "We will not tolerate this attack from the left," despite the fact that no information about the shooter's background or motivation was publicly known at that point. The post was subsequently deleted. Kelly introduced a resolution to formally call for a bipartisan House task force to investigate the incident. Kelly was then selected to chair the task force investigating the assassination attempt.
In September 2024, a few weeks before the 2024 United States presidential election, Kelly joined other Pennsylvania Republican members of Congress in filing a lawsuit that would institute new identification checks on voting for soldiers, sailors, and other residents of the state casting overseas ballots. The lawsuit was dismissed by a federal judge who contended that the lawsuit was filed too close to Election Day and declared concerns that were merely "hypothetical."


==== Economy ====
In March 2021, all House Republicans including Kelly voted against the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill.


==== Healthcare ====
Kelly supports Universal Patient Identifier(UPI) which enables efficient EHR electronic health record and HIEs Health Information Exchange interoperability. UPI can significantly improve the efficiency US healthcare system and reduce administrative cost, hence more affordable healthcare.
On August 1, 2012, Kelly called the HHS mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) - which requires employers to provide employees with health insurance options - an attack on Americans' constitutionally protected religious rights (because of mandates to cover contraceptives as part of the act) and said that August 1, 2012, would go down in infamy as "the day that religious freedom died".


==== LGBT rights ====
In 2015, Kelly cosponsored a resolution to amend the US constitution to ban same-sex marriage. In 2022, he was one of 157 Republicans to vote against a bill protecting same-sex and interracial marriage.


==== Financial disclosures ====
In September 2021, Business Insider reported that Kelly had violated the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act of 2012, a federal transparency and conflict-of-interest law, by failing to properly disclose a purchase of stock in Beauty Health Company made by his wife worth between $1,001 and $15,000.


== Awards and honors ==
In Kelly's time in Congress, he has independently sponsored three pieces of legislature that have become law: renaming a post office and renaming two facilities at the Department of Veterans Affairs (all located in Butler, PA).
In three consecutive Congresses, Kelly landed in the top one-third of most bipartisan members, according to The Lugar Center and Georgetown University's McCourt School of Public Policy.[2]
From 2018-2020, Kelly and his staff were named finalists for the Congressional Management Foundation's Constituent Service Award.[3]


== Personal life ==
Kelly lives in Butler, Pennsylvania with his wife Victoria. They have four children and ten grandchildren. He is the brother-in-law of retired Congressman Phil Roe of Tennessee's 1st congressional district. He is a practicing Roman Catholic.
In 2019, he said that, as a person of Irish and Anglo-Saxon descent, he considers himself a person of color—a term often used to describe people of nonwhite backgrounds.

Addison Graves "Joe" Wilson Sr. (born July 31, 1947) is an American politician and attorney serving as the U.S. representative for South Carolina's 2nd congressional district since 2001. A member of the Republican Party, his district stretches from Columbia to the Georgia–South Carolina border. He served as the South Carolina state senator from the 23rd district from 1985 to 2001.
Wilson is a member of the House Republican Policy Committee and an assistant Republican whip.
In September 2009, Wilson interrupted a speech by U.S. President Barack Obama to a joint session of Congress, shouting, "You lie!" The incident resulted in a reprimand by the House of Representatives.


== Early life and education ==
Wilson was born in Charleston, South Carolina, the son of Wray (née Graves) and Hugh deVeaux Wilson. In 1969 he obtained a bachelor's degree in political science from Washington and Lee University, where he joined Sigma Nu. He obtained his Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from the University of South Carolina School of Law in 1972.


== Early career ==
From 1972 to 1975, Wilson served in the United States Army Reserve. Thereafter, he was a Staff Judge Advocate in the South Carolina Army National Guard assigned to the 218th Mechanized Infantry Brigade until retiring from military service as a colonel in 2003.
A real estate attorney, Wilson co-accounted the law firm Kirkland, Wilson, Moore, Taylor & Thomas in West Columbia, where he practiced for over 25 years. He was also a municipal judge in Springdale, South Carolina.
Wilson was active in South Carolina Republican politics when the party barely existed in the state. He took part in his first Republican campaign in 1962, when he was 15 years old. He served as an aide to Senator Strom Thurmond and to his district's congressman, Floyd Spence.
In 1981 and 1982, during the first term of the Reagan administration, Wilson served as deputy general counsel for former governor Jim Edwards at the U.S. Department of Energy. Wilson is also a graduate of Morton Blackwell's Leadership Institute in Arlington, Virginia.


=== South Carolina Senate ===
Wilson was elected to the South Carolina Senate in 1984 as a Republican from Lexington County and reelected four times, the last three times unopposed. By this time, Lexington County had become one of the most Republican counties in the state. He never missed a regular legislative session in 17 years. After the Republicans gained control of the chamber in 1996, Wilson became the first Republican to chair the Senate Transportation Committee. He was a member of Columbia College's board of visitors and Coker College's board of trustees.
During his tenure in the South Carolina Senate, Wilson was the primary sponsor of bills including the following: establishing a National Guard license plate, providing paid leave for state employees to perform disaster relief services, and requiring men aged 18–26 to register for the Selective Service System when applying for a driver's license. In 2000, Wilson was one of seven senators to vote against removing the Confederate battle flag from being displayed over the state house.

Like his former boss, Spence, Wilson is an ardent social and fiscal conservative.
In 2003, Wilson voted for the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act, including its Section 1011 authorizing $250,000 annually of taxpayer money to reimburse hospitals for treatment of illegal immigrants. In 2009, he changed to his current position of opposing public funds for health care of illegal immigrants.


=== Legislation ===
Wilson has sponsored and co-sponsored a number of bills concerning teacher recruitment and retention, college campus fire safety, National Guard troop levels, arming airline pilots, tax credits for adoptions, tax credits for living organ donors, and state defense forces. As of January 2006, eight bills he co-sponsored have passed the House, including H.R. 1973, the Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2005, making safe water and sanitation an objective of U.S. assistance to developing countries.
Wilson is a staunch advocate of a federal prohibition of online poker. In 2006, he co-sponsored H.R. 4411, the Goodlatte-Leach Internet Gambling Prohibition Act, and H.R. 4777, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act.
Wilson initiated the Drafting Business Expensing Act of 2003, which allows businesses to immediately write off 50% of the cost of business equipment and machinery. This bonus depreciation provision was extended for 2008 and 2009 in two separate stimulus bills. He also spearheaded the Drafting Teacher Recruitment and Retention Act of 2003, which offers higher education loan forgiveness to math, science and special education teachers in schools with predominantly low-income student populations. He cites as his most important vote the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003.
In 2015, Wilson cosponsored a resolution to amend the Constitution to ban same-sex marriage.
Wilson sponsored H.R. 6202, the American Tech Workforce Act of 2021, introduced by Representative Jim Banks. The legislation would establish a wage floor for the high-skill H-1B visa program, thereby significantly reducing employer dependence on the program. The bill would also eliminate the Optional Practical Training program that allows foreign graduates to stay and work in the United States.


=== "You lie!" outburst during Obama address ===

On September 9, 2009, during a nationally televised joint address to Congress by President Barack Obama, Wilson shouted "You lie!" after Obama, while outlining his proposal for reforming health care, said, "There are also those who claim that our reform effort will insure illegal immigrants. This, too, is false—the reforms I'm proposing would not apply to those who are here illegally."
Obama's chief of staff Rahm Emanuel immediately approached senior Republican lawmakers and asked them to identify the heckler and urge him to apologize immediately. Members of Congress from both parties condemned the outburst. "Totally disrespectful", said Senator John McCain of Wilson's utterance. "No place for it in that setting or any other and he should apologize immediately." Wilson said later in a statement:

This evening I let my emotions get the best of me when listening to the President's remarks regarding the coverage of undocumented immigrants in the health care bill. While I disagree with the President's statement, my comments were inappropriate and regrettable. I extend sincere apologies to the President for this lack of civility.
Obama accepted his apology. "I'm a big believer that we all make mistakes", he said. "He apologized quickly and without equivocation and I'm appreciative of that."

House Democrats called on Wilson to issue a formal apology on the House floor. House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn said, "This is about the rules of the House". House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said, "What's at issue here is of importance to the House and of importance to the country ... This House cannot stay silent".
Wilson refused to apologize to the House of Representatives, saying in a televised interview, "I believe one apology is sufficient." Congressional Republicans agreed, and opposed further action. Minority Leader John Boehner said, "I think this is a sad day for the House of Representatives ... I think this is a political stunt aimed at distracting the American people from what they really care about, which is health care." On September 15, the House approved a "resolution of disapproval" against Wilson by a 240–179 vote almost exactly along party lines.
Wilson said that his outburst reflected his view that Obama's bill would provide government-subsidized benefits to illegal immigrants. Several fact-checking organizations wrote that Wilson's view was inaccurate because HR 3200 expressly excludes undocumented aliens from receiving government-subsidized "affordability credits". The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service agreed that people would need to be lawfully present in the U.S. in order to be eligible for the credits, but noted that the bill did not bar non-citizens from buying their own health insurance coverage through the health insurance exchange. The Obama administration said that, in the final bill, undocumented immigrants would not be able to participate in the Exchange. Such language was included in the Senate Finance Committee's version of the bill, America's Healthy Future Act.
After the incident, Wilson and Democrat Rob Miller, his 2010 general election opponent, experienced a significant upswing in campaign donations. In the week after Wilson's outburst, Miller raised $1.6 million, about three times his 2008 donations, while Wilson raised $1.8 million.


=== Apology for remarks about hatred of America ===
On a 2002 live broadcast of the C-SPAN talk show Washington Journal, Wilson and Representative Bob Filner were discussing Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. When Filner noted that the U.S. provided Iraq with "chemical and biological weapons" in the 1980s, Wilson stated that this idea was "made up" and told Filner, "This hatred of America by some people is just outrageous. And you need to get over that." Wilson apologized for his remarks in statements to the press.


=== Apology for remarks about Strom Thurmond's daughter ===
In 2003, Essie Mae Washington-Williams revealed she was the daughter of Wilson's former employer, Senator Strom Thurmond, and Thurmond's black maid. Wilson was among those who publicly doubted her assertion that Thurmond had a child out of wedlock. Wilson said even if her story were true, she should not have revealed it because "it's a smear" on Thurmond's image and was a way to "diminish" Thurmond's legacy. After Thurmond's family acknowledged the truth of Washington-Williams's revelation, Wilson apologized, but said that he still thought that she should not have revealed that Thurmond was her father.


=== Texas v. Pennsylvania ===
In December 2020, Wilson was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated incumbent Donald Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.


=== Veterans ===
The PACT ACT which expanded VA benefits to veterans exposed to toxic chemicals during their military service, received a "nay" from Wilson. Regarding cannabis, despite lobbying from VSOs such as the DAV Wilson also voted against 2022 MORE Act.


=== Opposition to Georgian Dream ===

In May 2024, in response to the Georgian protests of 2023-2024, Wilson introduced the MEGOBARI Act in the United States House of Representatives. The act targets Georgian Dream party officials and others deemed responsible for undermining democracy in Georgia. It also tasks U.S. government agencies with reporting to Congress on improper influence, sanctions evasion, and the activities of Russian intelligence assets in Georgia.
On 26 December 2024 Wilson wrote on X that “President Donald Trump has made it very clear where he stands on the self-professed enemies of America. If Bidzina Ivanishvili goes through with his plan to destroy Georgian democracy on December 29, he should expect a response like he’s never imagined.” He also posted, “Corrupt Bidzina Ivanishvili, a lover of China & Iran and hater of America, is trying to transform Georgia from a democracy into a dictatorship. We must put America First and cut all [funding] to Georgia if that happens.” and questioned Ivanishvili’s actions, writing, “Why did Georgia’s dictator-in-waiting Bidzina Ivanishvili give a contract to build the Anaklia Deep Sea Port to a sanctioned Chinese company? Are you ready for sanctions, Bidzina?”
On 27 December, Wilson, extended an invitation to President Salome Zourabichvili, recognizing her as the sole legitimate leader of Georgia, to attend the inauguration of Donald Trump. He wrote on X: "As the only legitimate leader in Georgia, I am grateful to extend an invite to President Salome Zourabichvili to attend the inauguration of President Donald Trump. I am in awe of her courage in the face of the assault by Ivanishvili and his friends in the CCP & Iranian regime."
On December 29, Wilson announced on X that he would introduce a bill in the U.S. Congress recognizing Salome Zourabichvili as the sole legitimate president of Georgia until fair re-elections are conducted in the country. He stated that the proposed legislation, titled the "Georgian Nightmare Non-Recognition Act", would prohibit U.S. recognition of the "illegal dictatorial regime" in Georgia and reaffirm Zourabichvili's legitimacy as the country's leader pending free and fair elections.


=== Other notable events ===

In November 2009, the New York Times reported that Wilson and Representative Blaine Luetkemeyer made identical written statements, reading, "One of the reasons I have long supported the U.S. biotechnology industry is that it is a homegrown success story that has been an engine of job creation in this country. Unfortunately, many of the largest companies that would seek to enter the biosimilar market have made their money by outsourcing their research to foreign countries like India." The statement was originally drafted by lobbyists for Genentech, now a Swiss biotechnology firm, but founded and still headquartered in San Francisco, California.
Wilson supported President Trump's 2017 executive order to impose a temporary ban on entry to the U.S. to citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, saying that the order would "secure our borders and keep American families safe from terrorist attacks."
On April 10, 2017, a Wilson town hall meeting at Aiken Technical College in Graniteville, South Carolina was interrupted by activists chanting "you lie" as Wilson asserted that the Affordable Care Act was causing people to be denied health services.
In 2018, a segment with Wilson aired as part of Sacha Baron Cohen's Showtime series, Who is America?. Wilson endorses "Kinderguardians", a nonexistent program to teach and arm schoolchildren as young as 3 to protect themselves in the classroom. Advocating toddler carry, he says on camera, "A 3-year-old cannot defend itself from an assault rifle by throwing a Hello Kitty pencil case at it".
In January 2023, Wilson proposed a bill to direct "the Fine Arts Board to obtain a bust of the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, for display in the House of Representatives wing of the United States Capitol".
On October 30, 2024, Columbia Airport Expressway was renamed to the Congressman Joe Wilson Expressway. The sign unveiling was attended by South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT) staff and other current and former elected officials present including Attorney General of South Carolina Alan Wilson, South Carolina Secretary of Transportation Justin Powell, U.S. Congressman Ralph Norman, and Anton Gunn.

Wilson is the stepfather of Alan Wilson, who has served as Attorney General of South Carolina since 2011.
Wilson was named after Confederate brigadier general David A. Weisiger, the uncle of his great-great-grandmother. Wilson stated that Weisiger "was not a plantation owner; he was a bank cashier", but Weisiger owned seven slaves in Virginia. His great-great-grandfather Stephen H. Boineau owned 16 slaves.
In a 2005 guest article on Rediff.com, Wilson wrote that his father, Hugh, was a member of the Flying Tigers in World War II. The Wilson family attends First Presbyterian Church in Columbia.
On September 10, 2024, Wilson was hospitalized in Washington after collapsing at an event. Alan Wilson said his father was being treated for "stroke-like symptoms".


== Electoral history ==


=== South Carolina Senate (1984-2000) ===


=== United States House of Representatives (2001-2024) ===
Wilson was elected in 2001 in a special election caused by the death of Floyd Spence, his former boss. Wilson once said that a dying Spence called him from his hospital bed and asked him to run.
In a crowded five-way Republican primary—the real contest in this heavily Republican district—Wilson tallied 75% of the vote. He won the December 18 special election with 73% of the vote.

Wilson won election to a full term in 2002 with 84% of the vote, facing four minor-party candidates.

Wilson was mentioned as a possible candidate for retiring Senator Fritz Hollings's seat in 2004, but decided to run for a second House term. He defeated Democratic nominee Michael Ellisor and Constitution Party nominee Steve Lefemine with 65% of the vote. Wilson got 181,862 votes to Ellisor's 93,249 and Lefemine's 4,447, with 312 write-ins.

In 2006, Wilson defeated Ellisor again, with 62.7% of the vote.

In 2008, Wilson was reelected, defeating the Democratic nominee, Iraq War veteran Rob Miller, 54% to 46%. It was the closest race in the district in 20 years, and the closest race Wilson had faced in 24 years as an elected official. He survived by winning his native Lexington County by 33,000 votes, more than the overall margin of 26,000 votes.

Challenged by Miller, Libertarian nominee Eddie McCain, and Constitution Party nominee Marc Beaman, Wilson was reelected in 2010 with 53% of the vote.

Redistricting made the 2nd somewhat more compact. It lost Beaufort and Hilton Head Island. To make up for the loss in population, it absorbed all of Aiken County and a slice of Orangeburg County.
In the general election, Wilson ran unopposed and was reelected with 96% of the vote.

Challenged by Democratic nominee Phil Black and Labor Party nominee Harold Geddings III, Wilson was reelected in 2014 with 62% of the vote.

Challenged by Democratic nominee Arik Bjorn and American Party nominee Eddie McCain, Wilson was reelected in 2016 with 62% of the vote.

Challenged by Democratic nominee Sean Carrigan and American Party candidate Sonny Narang, Wilson was reelected in 2018 with 56.3% of the vote.

Challenged by Democratic nominee Adair Ford Boroughs and Constitution Party candidate Kathleen K Wright, Wilson was reelected in 2020 with 55.66% of the vote.

Challenged by Democratic nominee Judd Larkins, Wilson was reelected in 2022 with 60.1% of the vote.

Challenged by Democratic nominee David Robinson, Wilson was reelected in 2024 with 59.5% of the vote.

Ralph Warren Norman Jr. (born June 20, 1953) is an American real estate developer and politician who has served as the U.S. representative for South Carolina's 5th congressional district since 2017. His district includes most of the South Carolina side of the Charlotte metropolitan area, along with outer portions of the Upstate and Midlands. A member of the Republican Party, Norman served as the South Carolina state representative for the 48th district from 2005 to 2007 and from 2009 to 2017.
Norman won a special election after Mick Mulvaney vacated his seat in Congress upon being appointed director of the Office of Management and Budget by President Donald Trump. As of 2019, with a net worth of $18.3 million, Norman is the 28th wealthiest member of Congress. Govtrack.us ranked Norman as the most conservative member of the 117th Congress as of February 2023.
He advocated for the implementation of martial law to prevent the peaceful transfer of power to President-elect Joe Biden in January 2021.


== Early life and education ==
Norman was born in York County, South Carolina. He received a bachelor's degree in business from Presbyterian College in 1975.


== Career ==
Norman resides in Rock Hill, where he is a real estate developer at the Warren Norman Company, a business founded by and named after Norman's father.


=== South Carolina House of Representatives ===
In 2004, Norman was elected to serve District 48 in the South Carolina House of Representatives, winning a three-way Republican primary outright with 52% of the vote. After one term, Norman chose not to run for reelection so he could become the 2006 Republican candidate for U.S. Congress in South Carolina's 5th congressional district against John Spratt. He lost to Spratt.
On November 3, 2009, Norman defeated Democrat Kathy Cantrell in a special election to reclaim his old seat.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 2017 special election ====

In December 2016, President Donald Trump nominated Mick Mulvaney for Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). At the time, Mulvaney represented South Carolina's 5th Congressional District in the United States House of Representatives. Shortly after the nomination, and in anticipation that Mulvaney's seat in Congress would be vacated once the United States Senate confirmed him, Norman announced his intention to resign from the South Carolina House of Representatives to run for Congress.
On May 16, 2017, Norman won a Republican primary runoff election against Tommy Pope by a margin of 0.6%, triggering an automatic recount per South Carolina state law. Following that recount, the South Carolina State Election Commission certified Norman as the Republican nominee on May 19, 2017. With 35,425 votes cast, Norman received 17,823 to Pope's 17,602, a 221-vote difference.
Having secured the Republican nomination, Norman faced Democratic nominee Sumter attorney Archie Parnell in a special election on June 20. Norman received 51.0% of the vote to Parnell's 47.9%.
Norman was sworn into office on June 26, 2017.


==== 2018 ====

On March 19, 2018, Norman filed for reelection with the South Carolina Election Commission. Facing no primary challengers, he secured the Republican party nomination after the primary election on June 12.
Meanwhile, Parnell chose to run again for South Carolina's 5th Congressional District seat. He defeated three opponents to win the Democratic nomination, and faced Norman again in the general election.
The general election was on November 6. Norman was reelected with 57.0% of the vote to Parnell's 41.5%. State and national Democrats had distanced themselves from Parnell after news broke that he had abused his first wife.


==== 2020 ====
Norman filed for reelection on March 16, 2020. He secured the Republican nomination after facing no Republican challengers in the primary election on June 12.
Norman went on to defeat Democrat Mauricus "Moe" Brown in the general election on November 3. He received 60.1% of the vote to Brown's 39.9%.
In 2022 and 2024, he faced and defeated Democratic nominee Evangeline Hundley. 


=== Tenure ===
As of the 117th Congress, Norman voted with President Joe Biden's stated position 2% of the time according to a FiveThirtyEight analysis.


==== Silfab Solar Controversy ====
In 2024 he became the target of protests from members of his district over the controversial plan for Canadian solar panel manufacturer Silfab Solar Inc. to build a solar panel manufacturing plant in Norman's district. The controversy stems around the Canadian company's plan to use the toxic gas Silane at a site zoned by the York County Zoning Board as "Light Industrial". The proposed site sits adjacent to an elementary and middle school, prompting fears there would not be time to evacuate thousands of children in time. The York County Board of Zoning Appeals ruled unanimously that York County staff erred and solar panel and cell manufacturing is prohibited, reversing York County staff’s interpretation on May 9, 2024. Silfab appealed the York zoning vote, though the county has asserted they don't have to, in violation of the order of the Board of Zoning appeals decision.
Norman became a target of the protest due to his founding of The Bipartisan Congressional Solar Caucus with Illinois Democrat Raja Krishnamoorthi.


==== Kavanaugh hearings joke ====
On September 20, 2018, at an election debate for the Republican nomination, Norman joked about sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. He kicked off the debate by asking the audience, "Did y'all hear this latest late-breaking news on the Kavanaugh hearings? ... Ruth Bader Ginsburg came out saying she was groped by Abraham Lincoln."


==== Firearm incident ====

At a public meeting for constituents on April 6, 2018, Norman engaged in a conversation with representatives from Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America (MDA). During that conversation, he placed his .38-caliber Smith & Wesson handgun on the table to illustrate his belief that "gun violence is a spiritual, mental or people issue, not a gun issue." According to Norman, the loaded firearm was visible for "maybe a minute, or two minutes" and was never pointed at any individual, but MDA representatives who were seated at the table with Norman said the firearm was visible for "five to 10 minutes" and that they felt unsafe. Norman holds a concealed weapons permit issued by South Carolina.
The incident sparked widespread criticism of Norman. On April 9, 2018, South Carolina Democratic Party Chair Trav Robertson wrote the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division a letter requesting felony charges against Norman for his conduct. The case was originally assigned to South Carolina 16th Solicitor Kevin Brackett, but Brackett recused himself, citing a "personal friendship" with Norman. The issue was then forwarded to South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson, who declined to press charges, stating that Norman's actions did not "warrant a criminal investigation" or constitute "a prosecutable offense."


==== Conservative Political Action Conference attendance ====
In late February 2021, Norman and a dozen other Republican House members skipped votes and enlisted others to vote for them, citing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. But he and the other members were actually attending the Conservative Political Action Conference, which was held at the same time as their slated absences. In response, the Campaign for Accountability, an ethics watchdog group, filed a complaint with the House Committee on Ethics and requested an investigation into Norman and the other lawmakers.


==== Conservative Opportunity Society ====
In 2021, Norman was elected chair of the Conservative Opportunity Society.


==== COVID-19 pandemic ====
In 2021, Norman violated House rules by not wearing a face mask in the House Chamber and was fined $500 as provided by the rules. Despite committing the infraction, he and two other Republican lawmakers sued Speaker Pelosi over the incident. Norman tested positive for COVID-19 on August 5, 2021, and reported that he had been fully vaccinated and had only mild symptoms.


==== Federal loans ====
In August 2022, Norman criticized President Joe Biden for forgiving up to $10,000 of student loan debt for eligible borrowers. Norman was criticized for hypocrisy because he had $306,520 of debt from his PPP loan forgiven.


==== Biden impeachment inquiry ====
Norman supported the inquiry into an impeachment of Joe Biden, and said on the House floor that Biden would need to "prove" his innocence, which runs counter to the long held American legal principle of "innocent until proven guilty":

The evidence, I think, as things come out, will finally show what the trail is, and the fact that there are consequences. You cannot just say you are innocent and not have to prove it.


=== Political positions ===


==== Steve King ====
In 2019, Norman joined a small group of House Republicans who sought to reinstate Representative Steve King on House committees. King had lost his committee positions due to a series of racist and white nationalist remarks. The group included Louie Gohmert and Paul Gosar. King was not reinstated.


==== Donald Trump ====
Norman was described as a Trump ally during Donald Trump's presidency. After Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election and Trump made claims of election fraud, Norman called for an investigation into fraud.
In December 2020, Norman was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.
On October 31, 2019, Norman voted with his fellow Republicans in opposition to a resolution outlining rules for then-ongoing impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump. On December 18, 2019, Norman voted against both of the articles of impeachment of the first impeachment of President Trump.
After Trump was impeached for his alleged incitement of a pro-Trump mob to storm the U.S. Capitol over false claims of election fraud, Norman criticized Representative Liz Cheney for voting to  impeach Trump. Norman said he was "bothered by Cheney's attitude". Norman himself voted against the second impeachment of Trump. On January 17, 2021, Norman sent a text message to White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows asking him to urge President Trump to invoke martial law (misspelling it 'Marshall Law') to prevent the inauguration of Joe Biden.
However, Norman endorsed longtime ally Nikki Haley for president over Trump in the 2024 Republican primaries.


==== Biden administration ====
Norman is a supporter of efforts to impeach President Biden. During the 117th United States Congress, he co-sponsored two resolutions to impeach Biden. He also co-sponsored resolutions to impeach Vice President Kamala Harris, Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken.


==== U.S. Capitol Police ====
In June 2021, Norman was one of 21 House Republicans to vote against a resolution to give the Congressional Gold Medal to police officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on January 6.


==== Juneteenth ====
In June 2021, Norman was one of 14 House Republicans to vote against legislation to establish June 19, or Juneteenth, as a federal holiday.

Diana Lynn Harshbarger ( HARSH-bar-gər; born January 1, 1960) is an American pharmacist, businesswoman, and politician. A member of the Republican Party, she has served as the U.S. representative for Tennessee's 1st congressional district since January 3, 2021. Her district is based in the Tri-Cities area in northeastern Tennessee.


== Early life and career ==
Harshbarger was born in Kingsport, Tennessee, and raised in nearby Bloomingdale. She is the first person in her family to graduate from high school. She earned her bachelor's degree from East Tennessee State University and her Doctor of Pharmacy from Mercer University.
Harshbarger has been a licensed pharmacist since 1987. She and her husband, Bob, operate Premier Pharmacy, a compounding pharmacy.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Election ===


==== 2020 ====

After six-term incumbent and fellow Republican Phil Roe opted to retire from the United States House of Representatives, Harshbarger announced her candidacy to succeed him in the United States House of Representatives for Tennessee's 1st congressional district. She won the 17-way August 5 Republican primary and defeated Democratic nominee Blair Walsingham in the November general election. She had effectively clinched a seat in Congress with her victory in the primary, since the 1st is one of the few ancestrally Republican districts in the South; it has been in Republican hands for all but four years since 1861, and Democrats have garnered as much as 40% of the vote only twice since 1898. When Harshbarger took office on January 3, 2021, she became the fifth woman elected to Congress from Tennessee, but only the third who was not a stand-in for her husband, after Diane Black and Marsha Blackburn. The 1st historically gives its incumbents very long tenures in Washington; Harshbarger is only the ninth person to hold the seat in 100 years.
Harshbarger focused her campaign on fixing the opioid crisis, advocating anti-abortion legislation, and protecting religious freedom. She also highlighted American dependence on Chinese pharmaceutical imports as an issue of national security. During the Republican primary, her opponents criticized her over her alleged involvement with American Inhalation Medication Specialists (AIMS), a business her husband ran that sold mislabeled pharmaceuticals from China. In 2013 Robert Harshbarger pleaded guilty to fraud charges related to the company and was sentenced to 48 months in federal prison, in addition to over $800,000 in restitution and over $400,000 in asset forfeiture. Harshbarger's campaign said she had no involvement with AIMS, despite corporate records to the contrary.
Harshbarger declined to debate her competitors during the primary and general elections.


=== Tenure ===
On January 6, 2021, supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol during debate. Lawmakers fled to an undisclosed location for safety. Later that evening, Harshbarger joined 139 other Republican House members in voting to sustain objections to the certification of the results of the 2020 U.S. presidential election, based on claims of voter fraud.
In August 2021, Business Insider reported that Harshbarger had violated the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act of 2012, a federal transparency and conflict-of-interest law, by failing to properly disclose over 700 stock trades worth between $728,000 and $10.9 million.
Harshbarger supports efforts to impeach President Joe Biden. In September 2021 Harshbarger co-sponsored a resolution by Marjorie Taylor Greene to impeach President Joe Biden over the withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan. In May, 2023, she co-sponsored a resolution by Greene to impeach Biden over his handling of security at the United States–Mexico border. Also in May 2023, she co-sponsored Greene's resolutions to impeach Attorney General Merrick Garland, FBI director Christopher Wray, Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, and U.S. attorney for D.C. Matthew M. Graves.
Harshbarger was among the 71 Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 in the House.
In 2024, Harshbarger voted against the $60 billion military aid package for Ukraine, although much of the money would go to her constituency.
In 2024, Harshbarger spoke against expanded coverage of anti-obesity drugs for Medicaid and Medicare recipients. She said, "Obesity is not a disease. It’s a side effect of different things, like unhealthy eating or whatever.  So no, I’m not in favor of that, because it’s going to put us in dire straits and run us out of money."

Timothy Floyd Burchett ( BUR-chit; born August 25, 1964) is an American politician who is the U.S. representative for Tennessee's 2nd congressional district, based in Knoxville, serving since 2019.
A Republican, Burchett was formerly mayor of Knox County, Tennessee. He served in the Tennessee General Assembly, first in the Tennessee House of Representatives, in which he represented Tennessee's 18th district. He later served in the Tennessee State Senate, representing the 7th district, part of Knox County.
Burchett is a part of the new House subcommittee overseeing President Trump's Department of Government Efficiency.


== Early life and education ==
Burchett is a native of Knoxville, Tennessee, where he was born in 1964. He attended West Hills Elementary School, Bearden Junior High School, and Bearden High School. After graduating from Bearden High School in 1982, he enrolled in the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, where he earned a Bachelor of Science in education in 1988. He is a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity.


== Tennessee General Assembly ==
Burchett's first election to public office was in 1994, when he won a seat in the Tennessee House of Representatives. He served in the House for two two-year terms, from 1995 to 1998. In 1998, he won a four-year term in the Tennessee State Senate, representing the 7th district. He succeeded Clyde Coulter "Bud" Gilbert. He was reelected twice, serving a total of three four-year terms, from 1999 to 2010.
In 2006, while a state senator, Burchett failed to report six political action committee checks totaling $3,300. The Registry of Election Finance did not fine him. In 2008, while still a state senator, he was fined $250 for failing to disclose three PAC contributions that totaled $1,500.
In 1999, Burchett received national media attention for sponsoring a bill to legalize the eating of roadkill, wild animals killed by vehicles, before notifying the county game warden. He defended the proposal as a "common-sense thing" intended to prevent edible meat from being wasted. Eating roadkill was already legal – as it is in most places – but required prior notification of the county game warden. Burchett's bill allowed processing and consumption of roadkill before notifying the warden. Burchett proposed the bill after being contacted by a constituent who had been penalized for giving a needy family the meat from a deer his vehicle had accidentally hit.

Burchett sponsored a bill in 2006 to make illegal "possessing, producing, manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to produce, manufacture, or distribute the active chemical ingredient in the hallucinogenic plant Salvia divinorum in the state of Tennessee." He said, "We have enough problems with illegal drugs as it is without people promoting getting high from some glorified weed that's been brought up from Mexico. The only people I’ve heard from who are opposed to making it illegal are those who are getting stoned on it." The bill was signed into law on May 19, 2006, and went into effect on July 1, 2006. Burchett originally wanted to make violations a felony offense, but the bill was amended during its passage to make it a Class A misdemeanor.
In a news report published shortly before the signing of the bill by Governor Phil Bredesen, Burchett was quoted as saying, "it's not that popular but I'm one of those who believes in closing the barn door before the cows get out.... in certain hands, it could be very dangerous, even lethal." A store owner who had stopped selling the herb due to Burchett's bill said that he saw little point in banning salvia, "I have no idea why it's being outlawed. It's a sage. People in South America have been using it for years and years." The same report also gave the general counterargument of salvia proponents that legislation banning Salvia divinorum reflects a cultural bias, as there are fewer prohibitions on more addictive substances such as alcohol and nicotine, and questioned how effective the bill will be, pointing out that Salvia divinorum has no odor and is easy to grow, so enforcement will be difficult.


== Knox County mayor ==

Burchett became Knox County mayor in September 2010, succeeding Mike Ragsdale, who left office due to term limits. Burchett defeated former Knox County Sheriff Tim Hutchison in the Republican primary and Democratic nominee Ezra Maize in the general election.
On February 10, 2012, Burchett appeared on WBIR-TV and officially announced that the county's first "cash mob" would be held at the Emery's 5 & 10 store in South Knoxville. The cash mob gained national attention, and was mentioned in Time magazine.
In 2012, Tennessee's Registry of Election Finance unanimously decided to take no action against Burchett regarding an inquiry into his campaign disclosure forms.


=== 2014 re-election ===
In 2014 Burchett ran unopposed in both the primary and the general election.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 2018 ====

When 30-year incumbent Jimmy Duncan announced his retirement in July 2017, Burchett entered a crowded seven-way Republican primary to succeed him. He defeated his nearest challenger, state representative Jimmy Matlock, by just under 12 percentage points. He faced Democratic nominee Renee Hoyos in the November general election. The 2nd has long been a Republican stronghold. With a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+20, it is one of the nation's most Republican districts, and tied for the third-most Republican district in Tennessee. It is one of the few ancestrally Republican districts in the South; the GOP and its predecessors have held it without interruption since 1859. For this reason, the Republican primary has long been reckoned as the real contest in this district. Democrats have not made a substantive bid for the seat since 1964, and have received as much as 40% of the vote only twice since then.
As expected, Burchett won the general election in a rout, taking 65.9% of the vote to Hoyos's 33.1%. When he took office in January 2019, Burchett became only the seventh person (not counting caretakers) to represent the 2nd since 1909. This district gives its representatives very long tenures in Washington; all six of Burchett's predecessors held the seat for at least 10 years, with three of them serving at least 20 years. He also ended a 54-year hold on the district by the Duncan family. John Duncan Sr. won the seat in 1964, and was succeeded upon his death in 1988 by his son, Jimmy.
In February 2018 the Knoxville News Sentinel reported that Burchett had failed to report a $10,000 payment from a solar electric company on his campaign finance forms and various financial disclosure forms. The story reported that two months earlier the FBI had questioned people about Burchett committing income tax evasion. After the story broke, Burchett gave a statement to WBIR that he was correcting errors in his campaign financial disclosures and income tax forms, describing his failure to report all income as an "oversight".


==== 2020 ====

Burchett was reelected in 2020 with 67.6% of the vote, defeating Democrat Renee Hoyos.


=== Tenure ===


==== Texas v. Pennsylvania ====
In December 2020, Burchett was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated incumbent Donald Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.


==== Iraq ====
In June 2021, Burchett was one of 49 House Republicans to vote to repeal the AUMF against Iraq.


==== Immigration ====
Burchett voted against the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020 which authorizes DHS to nearly double the available H-2B visas for the remainder of FY 2020.
Burchett voted against the Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1158), which effectively prohibits Immigration and Customs Enforcement from cooperating with the Department of Health and Human Services to detain or remove illegal alien sponsors of Unaccompanied Alien Children.


==== 2023 U.S. House Speaker election ====
During the 118th Congressional Speakership Election, Representative Matt Gaetz and a handful of other representatives were holdouts in voting for Rep. Kevin McCarthy for Speakership. Burchett voted for McCarthy on every ballot. While people claimed that after Burchett walked over and whispered into Gaetz's ear, Gaetz and others abstained, giving a majority to McCarthy for Speaker, Gaetz had in fact begun abstaining before this conversation.


==== Israel ====
Burchett voted to provide Israel with support following 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.


==== UFOs ====
Following a report published by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence on January 12, 2023, Burchett expressed his views about an alleged government coverup of the nature of UFOs, saying, "we've been covering this up since the '40s" and that he doesn't "trust [the] government, [and] there's an arrogance about it, and I think the American public can handle it."
On March 7, 2023, Burchett expanded on these claims, saying that UFO technology is possibly "being reverse-engineered right now" but we "don't understand" how it functions. He maintains that the U.S. has "recovered a craft at some point, and possible beings". In January 2025 Burchett claimed that aliens have secret underwater bases.


==== Syria ====
In 2023, Burchett was among 47 Republicans to vote for House Concurrent Resolution 21, that directed President Joe Biden to remove U.S. troops from Syria within 180 days. Texas Republican Michael McCaul, chair of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs disagreed, saying the U.S. participated in operations in 2022 with partners that killed 466 Islamic State operatives, detaining 250 more, contending that if the U.S. withdrew troops, it could result in an ISIS resurgence.


==== Tennessee school shooting response ====
On March 28, 2023, Burchett responded to the Covenant School shooting, where three nine-year-old students and three staff members were killed in Nashville, by telling reporters: "It's a horrible, horrible situation, and we're not going to fix it. Criminals are gonna be criminals. And my daddy fought in the second world war, fought in the Pacific, fought the Japanese, and he told me, he said, 'Buddy,' he said, 'if somebody wants to take you out, and doesn't mind losing their life, there's not a whole heck of a lot you can do about it.'" Burchett also said he sees no "real role" for Congress in reducing gun violence, other than to "mess things up".


==== 2024 Kansas City parade shooting response ====
After a local D.J. was killed and 22 others were wounded in the 2024 Kansas City parade shooting, Burchett inaccurately identified an adult attendee of the Kansas City rally, Denton Loudermill, Jr., as the shooter, claiming he was an "illegal alien". Burchett's social media post received 1.4 million views. In March 2024, the falsely identified man sued Burchett for $75,000 in damages. The lawsuit, which Loudermill had filed in a Kansas court, was dismissed in September 2024 due to lack of jurisdiction, considering the case had "nothing really to do with Kansas."


==== Debt Ceiling ====
In April 2023, Burchett was one of only four Republican representatives who voted against the proposed Limit, Save, Grow Act, which raised the debt ceiling while at the same time providing for cuts to non-mandatory spending, claiming he could not support any debt limit raise which did not provide fully balanced budget.
In June of the same year, Burchett was among the 71 Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 in the House.


==== Removal of Speaker McCarthy ====
On October 3, 2023, Burchett was one of eight Republicans who voted to remove Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House. He said his yes vote was "sealed" after McCarthy allegedly made a "condescending" remark about his religious beliefs during a phone call. McCarthy said that he did not intend to upset Burchett.


==== George Soros ====
In October 2024, Burchett told a Fox News radio station that George Soros is "a money changer of the worst kind" who "will destroy this country." The term money changer has been associated with antisemitic stereotypes. Burchett denied that his criticism of Soros, who is Jewish, was antisemitic, saying that "my voting record clearly reflects my support for Israel and the Jewish people.”


==== Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ====
Despite their highly contrasting positions on most issues, Burchett maintains a friendship with progressive Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, whom he met during freshmen orientation as a new representative in 2019 at the beginning of the 116th United States Congress.

Charles Joseph Fleischmann ( FLYSHE-mən; born October 11, 1962) is an American attorney and politician who has been the U.S. representative for Tennessee's 3rd congressional district since 2011. The district is based in Chattanooga and includes a large part of East Tennessee, including Oak Ridge. He is a member of the Republican Party.


== Early life, education, and law career ==
Fleischmann was born in Manhattan, New York City, and is a resident of Ooltewah, an unincorporated suburban community east of Chattanooga. He is the son of Rose Marie (née Salvo) and Max Fleischmann, Jr. Fleischmann is of Italian, English, and Austro-Hungarian descent, and is a distant relative of Harry Houdini.
Fleischmann graduated from Elk Grove High School in Elk Grove Village, Illinois. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. He received both Phi Beta Kappa and magna cum laude honors. He then earned a Juris Doctor from the University of Tennessee College of Law in Knoxville. He was the first member of his family to attend college.


== Early career ==
After graduating from law school, Fleischmann moved to Chattanooga, Tennessee, and founded an independent law firm, Fleischmann and Fleischmann, in 1987. He is a former president of the Chattanooga Bar Association and former chair of the Chattanooga Lawyers Pro Bono Committee.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===
2010

Republican incumbent Zach Wamp retired in order to run for governor, leaving this an open seat. Fleischmann entered an 11-way Republican primary—the real contest in this heavily Republican district. None of the candidates had ever run for elected office before. Fleischmann's biggest competition came from former state GOP chair Robin Smith, who was considered the front-runner. She was endorsed by former speaker of the U.S. House Newt Gingrich and the Club for Growth. Fleischmann won the primary with a plurality of 30% of the vote, defeating Smith by 1,415 votes. He won most of the counties in the district, which were mostly in the northern part of the district, while Smith won three counties: Rhea, Hamilton (home to Chattanooga), and Polk counties. Third-place finisher Tim Gobble won only Bradley County, his home county.
Fleischmann's Democratic opponent in the general election was John Wolfe, a fellow attorney. Fleischmann had faced Wolfe in his first case as an attorney. He said he won that case and the appeal "and now I want to defeat him a third time." His other opponent was independent candidate Savas Kyriakidis, an attorney, restaurant owner and Iraq War veteran. Fleischmann won the race with 57% of the vote.

2012

In his first reelection campaign, Fleischmann defeated Scottie Mayfield and Weston Wamp in the Republican primary, 39%-31%-29%. He defeated Democratic nominee Mary Headrick in the general election with a large majority of the vote.

2014

On November 4, 2014, Fleischmann defeated Headrick again with 62.3% of the vote.

2016

On November 8, 2016, Fleischmann defeated Democrat Melody Shekari and independent Rick Tyler with 66.4% of the vote.

2018

On November 6, 2018, Fleischmann defeated Democrat Danielle Mitchell and independent Rick Tyler with 63.7% of the vote.

2020

On November 3, 2020, Fleischmann defeated Democrat Meg Gorman with 67.3% of the vote.

2022

On November 8, 2022, Fleischmann defeated Democrat Meg Gorman with 68.4% of the vote.

2024

On November 5, 2024, Fleischmann defeated Democrat Jack Allen with 67.5% of the vote.


=== Tenure ===
In October 2021, Business Insider reported that Fleischmann had violated the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act of 2012, a federal transparency and conflict-of-interest law, by failing to properly disclose the purchase of stock in DraftKings Inc. and the sale of stock in Zimmer Biomet, each worth up to $15,000.


=== Political positions ===
Fleischmann tends to vote conservative. The conservative policy advocacy organization, Heritage Action, gave Fleischmann a lifetime score of 74 percent. The conservative and libertarian advocacy group, FreedomWorks, gave him a lifetime score of 70.6 percent.
The largest federation of unions in the United States, the AFL-CIO, gave Fleischmann a lifetime score of 12 percent.


==== Economy ====
In July 2011, Fleischmann originally supported Speaker John Boehner's debt limit bill, but voted against the final debt ceiling agreement.
In November 2011, Fleischmann filed a new bill, the Stop Green Initiative Abuse Act of 2011, which would repeal the Department of Energy's Weatherization Assistance Program. This program attempts to assist low-income families in lowering their energy bills by adding energy-efficient caulking and insulation to homes. A December 2010 Tennessee Comptroller's Office report concluded that funds for the program had been "wasted or misspent". Fleischmann's office estimated that if this bill passed it would save taxpayers $2.1 billion over the next decade. This was the third bill he proposed.
Fleischmann supports the use of nuclear power. His district contains the Sequoyah Nuclear Plant. He is the head of the House Nuclear Cleanup Caucus.


==== Election laws ====
In December 2020, Fleischmann was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated incumbent Donald Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.
House speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a statement that called signing the amicus brief an act of "election subversion." She also reprimanded Fleischmann and the other House members who supported the lawsuit: "The 126 Republican Members that signed onto this lawsuit brought dishonor to the House. Instead of upholding their oath to support and defend the Constitution, they chose to subvert the Constitution and undermine public trust in our sacred democratic institutions." New Jersey representative Bill Pascrell, citing section three of the 14th Amendment, called for Pelosi to not seat Fleischmann and the other Republicans who signed the brief supporting the suit, arguing that "the text of the 14th Amendment expressly forbids Members of Congress from engaging in rebellion against the United States. Trying to overturn a democratic election and install a dictator seems like a pretty clear example of that."


==== Foreign policy ====
Fleischmann voted to provide Israel with support following the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel. When asked about Palestinian deaths from the ongoing Israel–Hamas war, Fleischmann said "I will always support Israel, and you can tell the Palestinians I will never support them." Fleischmann denied Israel is committing a genocide against the Palestinians.
Fleischmann supports sending United States aid to Ukraine.


==== Government speech ====
Fleischmann was one of 120 Republicans who voted against removing Confederate statues from inside the Capitol building.
On November 16, 2011, Fleischmann voted for a bill that encourages the display of "In God We Trust" in public buildings and schools and reinforces it as the motto of the United States.


==== Gun laws ====

Fleischmann has been a firm opponent of gun control. He has received an "A" rating from the interest groups "National Rifle Association Political Fund Positions on Gun Rights" and "Gun Owners of America Positions on Gun Rights". He supports legislation that "allows licensed firearm owners to carry out their God-given right more freely" because "the right to carry a firearm is a right that allows law-abiding citizens to protect themselves and is crucial to the freedom of our country." On November 16, 2011, Fleischmann voted for the National Right-to-Carry Reciprocity Act of 2011, which would allow a resident of a state that allows concealed carry to possess a firearm while visiting another state that has different firearm laws.


==== Health care ====
Fleischmann's first vote in office was for the 2011 motion Repealing the Health Care Bill.


==== Spending ====

In 2023 Fleishmann led the US Congress in self-appointed earmark spending, securing $273.3 million for his district out of the 2024 federal budget. The majority of this spending is destined for the lock replacement project on the Chickamauga Dam, which is the single highest-cost project in the country in the 2024 budget.

Scott Eugene DesJarlais ( DAY-zhar-LAY; born February 21, 1964) is an American politician and physician serving as the U.S. representative for Tennessee's 4th congressional district since 2011. The district stretches across East and Middle Tennessee.  He is a member of the Republican Party.


== Early life, education, and medical career ==
DesJarlais was born in 1964 in Des Moines, Iowa, to Joe DesJarlais, a barber, and Sylvia, a registered nurse. He grew up in Sturgis, South Dakota. Over ten years he, his parents and his brother and sister built their own house in Sturgis; his parents still live there. DesJarlais earned his undergraduate degree in Chemistry and Psychology from the University of South Dakota in 1987 and his Doctor of Medicine from the University of South Dakota School of Medicine in 1991. He moved to East Tennessee in 1993 to practice medicine as a generalist.
DesJarlais is an Episcopalian.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 2010 ====

DesJarlais is a member of the Tea Party movement. In 2009 he entered politics, filing papers to challenge Democratic incumbent Lincoln Davis, as well as Independents Paul H. Curtis, James Gray, Richard S. Johnson, and Gerald York.
Late in the 2010 race, the Washington newspaper Roll Call reported details of DesJarlais's 2001 divorce proceedings, which showed that his ex-wife accused him of harassment, intimidation and physical abuse. The Davis campaign used the material in print and TV attack ads and told Roll Call that Fourth District voters "expect[ed] more than lip service about family values."
DesJarlais defeated Davis 57%–39%.


==== 2012 ====

During his first term, DesJarlais represented a district that stretched almost diagonally across the state from coal-mining regions near Knoxville, the Tri-Cities and Chattanooga to the outer suburbs of Nashville.
By the 2012 election, the Fourth District had been significantly altered as a result of redistricting. It lost all of its northeastern portion and was pushed west to take in suburban areas closer to Nashville, including Murfreesboro, previously the heart of the 6th district. The redrawn 4th contained about half of the constituents who resided in the former 4th district, with 14 of 24 counties moved elsewhere.
DesJarlais was challenged by Democratic nominee and state senator Eric Stewart. For a time, it was thought that DesJarlais would face a primary challenge from state senator Bill Ketron, a Murfreesboro resident and the chairman of the state senate redistricting committee, but Ketron did not run. DesJarlais defeated Stewart 56%–44%, joining all the other incumbent members of Tennessee congressional delegation in winning reelection.


==== 2014 ====

In 2014 DesJarlais's seat was considered vulnerable, as controversy over the divorce record revelations returned to the fore. He had been reelected in 2012 with a reduced majority. DesJarlais held his seat.
State senator Jim Tracy challenged DesJarlais in the primary. At the end of June 2013, Tracy had raised nearly $750,000 (including over $300,000 in the second quarter of 2013) for his bid. He raised an additional $150,000 in the fourth quarter and reported $840,000 cash on hand. By contrast, at the end of September, DesJarlais reported $170,000 cash on hand. DesJarlais won the primary by 38 votes. Tracy decided not to challenge the results, despite citing irregularities.


==== 2016 ====

In January 2016, Politico rated Tennessee's Fourth District one of the top five primary races to watch, and in March ranked DesJarlais one of the most vulnerable incumbents in the 2016 cycle; he was one of only two Tennessee incumbents to face serious challenge. His primary opponents were attorney and conservative activist Grant Starrett, attorney and physician Yomi "Fapas" Faparusi and economic data specialist Erran Persley. The Murfreesboro Post described Starrett as "running to the right of DesJarlais". After winning the primary, DesJarlais beat Democrat Steven Reynolds in the general election by a margin of 30 points.


==== 2018 ====

DesJarlais was again challenged in the primary, but won by 40 points. He went on to win the general election by almost 30 points.


==== 2020 ====

In 2020 DesJarlais defeated Republican primary challenger Doug Meyer, a veteran and former police officer. Christopher Hale won the Democratic primary. Hale describes himself as a "pro-life Democrat" and strongly criticized DesJarlais for having pressured his mistress to get an abortion.


==== 2022 ====

In 2022 DesJarlais won re-election.


=== Tenure ===
In December 2020, DesJarlais was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated incumbent Donald Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.
In June 2021, DesJarlais was one of 14 House Republicans to vote against legislation to establish June 19, or Juneteenth, as a federal holiday.
In July 2021, DesJarlais voted against the bipartisan ALLIES Act, which would increase by 8,000 the number of special immigrant visas for Afghan allies of the U.S. military during its invasion of Afghanistan, while also reducing some application requirements that caused long application backlogs; the bill passed in the House 407–16.
In 2022, DesJarlais was one of 39 Republicans to vote for the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act of 2022, an antitrust package that would crack down on corporations for anti-competitive behavior.
DesJarlais was among the 71 Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 in the House.
DesJarlais voted to provide Israel with support following 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.

DesJarlais was the first member of the House Freedom Caucus to endorse Donald Trump for president of the United States.


== Sex, abortion, and drug scandals ==
In October 2012 the Huffington Post obtained a transcript of a September 2000 phone conversation in which DesJarlais pressured a mistress to get an abortion. He repeatedly denied that he had taped the conversation. In October he wrote to supporters on Facebook, "The media wrongly reported that I recorded the conversation myself. I was recorded unknowingly and without my consent." Nine days before the general election a second woman said that she began dating DesJarlais while she was his patient. She alleged that the two smoked marijuana together and that he prescribed opioids for her while she was at his house.
Two weeks after DesJarlais won the 2012 election, the Chattanooga Times Free Press obtained a full transcript of his 2001 divorce proceedings. The transcript revealed that he had admitted under oath to at least six sexual relationships with people he came in contact with while chief of staff at Grandview Medical Center in Jasper, Tennessee. Among them were three co-workers, two patients and a drug representative. The transcript also revealed that his former wife had had two abortions, and that DesJarlais had admitted under oath that he and his former wife had recorded the phone conversation with the mistress. "One of the biggest mistakes I made was I commented to the press before I had the opportunity to go back and read a transcript that was 13, 14 years old," he said in an interview with the Knoxville News Sentinel. "It was never my intention to mislead anyone, and had I read this, I don't think the inaccuracies that occurred would have taken place."
Three weeks after he won the election, DesJarlais said on a conservative talk radio show on WWTN that "God has forgiven me" and asked "fellow Christians" and constituents "to consider doing the same."


=== Formal reprimand ===
In October 2012, the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) requested that the Tennessee Board of Health investigate evidence that DesJarlais had had a sexual relationship with a patient, in violation of the Tennessee Medical Practice Act. The complaint was investigated and in May 2013 the Tennessee Board of Medical Examiners formally reprimanded DesJarlais for having sex with patients and fined him $500, calculated by the Board as "$250 per patient", and $1,000 in costs. He did not contest the charges.
In November 2012, after further details of the divorce proceedings were published, CREW asked the House of Representatives' Office of Congressional Ethics to investigate whether DesJarlais had violated House ethics rules, asserting that he had "blatantly" lied when he denied having taped the telephone conversation.


== Personal life ==
DesJarlais and his second wife, Amy, have three children. They live in South Pittsburg. They are members of the Epiphany Mission Episcopal Church in Sherwood, Tennessee.
During a trial for his divorce from his first wife in 2000, DesJarlais testified that he had sexual affairs with at least two patients, three coworkers and a drug representative while he was working as a hospital chief of staff.
Despite his public opposition to legal abortion, DesJarlais encouraged his ex-wife to terminate two pregnancies and encouraged a former patient with whom he was having an affair to get an abortion.
In divorce documents, DesJarlais's first wife accused him of "dry firing a gun outside [her] locked bedroom door, admission of suicidal ideation, holding a gun in his mouth for three hours, an incident of physical intimidation at the hospital; and previous threatening behavior … i.e. shoving, tripping, pushing down, etc."


=== Health ===
In July 2014, DesJarlais announced he was undergoing aggressive chemotherapy to treat cancer in his neck that had spread to a lymph node. In a campaign appearance during his illness he said the cancer had affected his voice but added that the type is curable 90% of the time. The cancer and chemotherapy caused him to lose over 40 pounds, limiting his ability to make appearances and campaign. In June 2015, DesJarlais announced that he was cancer-free.

Mark Edward Green (born November 8, 1964) is an American politician, physician, and retired U.S. Army officer who has served as the U.S. representative for Tennessee's 7th congressional district since 2019. As a member of the Republican Party, Green has chaired the Committee on Homeland Security since 2023. Before his election to Congress, he served in the Tennessee Senate from 2013 to 2018, representing the 22nd district.
After graduating from West Point, Green was an infantry officer. He then graduated from Boonshoft School of Medicine at Wright State University and became a flight surgeon, serving tours of duty in the War in Afghanistan and Iraq War. He wrote a book about his experience in Operation Red Dawn, in which Saddam Hussein was captured. After retiring from the military in 2006, Green became the CEO of a hospital emergency department staffing company.
Green first entered state politics in 2012 by defeating Democratic incumbent Tim Barnes for a seat in the Tennessee Senate. In 2017, President Donald Trump nominated Green to serve as the United States Secretary of the Army, but when comments Green had made about the LGBT community were revealed, he withdrew his nomination. When U.S. Representative Marsha Blackburn announced her candidacy for the United States Senate in 2018, Green announced his candidacy to succeed her, and was elected in November of that year. He was reelected in 2020 and 2022. In October 2023, he was a candidate for Speaker of the House of Representatives, but withdrew from the race on October 24.


== Military career ==
In 1986, Green graduated from the United States Military Academy, where he earned a Bachelor of Science in quantitative business management. In 1987 he earned a master's degree in systems management from the  University of Southern California. From 1987 to 1990, Green served as an infantry officer in the United States Army. His first duty assignment after graduation from the US Army Ranger School was with the 194th Armored Brigade at Fort Knox. There he served as a rifle platoon leader, scout platoon leader, and battalion adjutant for an infantry battalion. After the Infantry Officer's Advance Course, then-Captain Green served with the 82nd Airborne Division as an airborne battalion supply officer and rifle company commander.
Following a traumatic event in which a team of surgeons and critical care doctors saved his father's life, Green requested that the Army send him to medical school. He attended the Boonshoft School of Medicine at Wright State University, graduating with a Doctor of Medicine in 1999. He did his residency in emergency medicine at Fort Hood, Texas. After his residency, Green was selected to serve as the flight surgeon for the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment.
As a special operations flight surgeon, Green served a tour of duty in the Afghanistan War and two tours of duty in the Iraq War. He was the special operations flight surgeon during Operation Red Dawn, the military operation that captured Saddam Hussein. Green interrogated Hussein for six hours. After his military service, he authored a book, A Night With Saddam, detailing the capture and interrogation of Hussein and his service with the Army's elite aviation unit. Green was honorably discharged from the Army in 2006.
For his service, Green was awarded the Bronze Star, the Meritorious Service Medal with two oak leaf clusters, the Army Commendation Medal with two oak leaf clusters, the Achievement Medal with three oak leaf clusters, the Air Medal with the V Device for valor under heavy enemy fire while rescuing British Special Operations forces wounded near Fallujah, and the Combat Medical Badge, among other awards. He also earned the Air Assault Badge and the Flight Surgeon Badge during his service.


== Civilian career ==
Green founded and served as chief executive officer of Align MD, a hospital emergency department management staffing company. Align MD provides staffing to emergency departments and hospital services in 50 hospitals in 10 states. Green also founded Two Rivers Medical Foundation, which provides health care to underserved populations worldwide via medical mission trips, and operates a free medical clinic in his hometown and in Memphis, Tennessee.
Green served on the boards of several for-profit companies, including American Physician Partners, Align MD, and Rural Physician Partners. Green is also a board member of the Middle Tennessee Boy Scouts of America. He has served on the advisory board of the political organization Latinos for Tennessee since 2015.
In 2015, Williamson College awarded Green an honorary Doctorate of Humanities.


== Political career ==


=== Tennessee State Senate ===
Green was first elected to the Tennessee Senate in 2012, defeating Democratic incumbent Tim Barnes. He was rumored to be considering a challenge to Lamar Alexander in the 2014 U.S. Senate election, but declined to do so.
Green is most noteworthy for his legislation ending Tennessee's Hall Income Tax, only the second time in US history a state has repealed an income tax. He also co-sponsored a bill that eliminated the statute of limitations on rape cases where the DNA profile of the suspect is known. Green received awards recognizing his many laws protecting veterans and small businesses. He led the charge in Tennessee for automated technology in auto manufacturing, speaking at national conferences on the topic.
In 2015, Green proposed a pilot program to test an innovative solution to health care. The idea was to give Medicaid patients a reduced amount of health care dollars on a swipe card, giving them choice and control. The incentive is that any dollars not spent go to the patient as an addition to their earned income check. SJR 88 passed and was signed by the governor. The request for a waiver to test the program is at CMS for approval.
Green won the 2016 Republican primary 84% to 16% over Lori Smith of Clarksville, Tennessee. In the general election, he defeated Democratic nominee David Cutting, 67% to 33%.


=== Nomination as U.S. Army Secretary ===
In April 2017, President Donald Trump nominated Green for United States Secretary of the Army. Green was Trump's second nominee for this position after his first nominee, Vincent Viola, withdrew from consideration.
Green drew some opposition based on public comments about transgender people. At a September 2016 Tea Party gathering in Chattanooga, Tennessee, Green said, "If you polled the psychiatrists, they're going to tell you that transgender is a disease." He also supported a state law that limited access to public restrooms for transgender people to those matching their legal sex, not their gender identity, and told internet radio talk show host CJ Porter that he viewed his support of that law as part of his duty as a state senator to "crush evil".
Green also said that if school districts "want to have a bathroom that's separate for all of the, you know, guys or gals with question marks" but were concerned the "AFL-CIO is going to sue you, well, I got your back." It is assumed Green meant the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), not the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL–CIO). Green also said that he would "not tolerate" students learning about Muslim beliefs and practices. Green added later that he doesn't "think we should teach the Lord's Prayer" in schools either. In a call for separation of church and state, he said, "Leave that to the churches, the synagogues, and the mosques."
Green withdrew his nomination on May 5, 2017.


=== 2018 Tennessee gubernatorial election ===

On January 4, 2017, Green filed paperwork to run for governor in the 2018 gubernatorial election. But in late 2017, when 7th District Representative Marsha Blackburn announced her candidacy for the United States Senate, Green announced he was running for the open congressional seat. His state senate district included almost all of the northeastern part of the congressional district.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 2018 ====

Green became the Republican nominee for the 2018 U.S. House of Representatives election in Tennessee's 7th congressional district after running unopposed for the nomination. His State Senate district included much of the northern part of the congressional district. Green won the general election in November and took office in January 2019.


==== 2020 ====

In the 2020 Republican primary, Green was unopposed. On November 3, he defeated Democratic nominee Kiran Sreepada and two independents with 69.9% of the vote.


==== 2022 ====

In the 2022 Republican primary, Green was unopposed. On November 8, he defeated Democratic nominee Odessa Kelly with 60.0% of the vote.


=== Tenure ===
After incumbent U.S. Senator Lamar Alexander announced he would not seek reelection in 2020, Green was considered a likely candidate for the seat. But on July 11, 2019, he announced that he would not be a candidate.
In late February 2021, Green and a dozen other Republican House members skipped votes and enlisted others to vote for them, citing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. But he and the other members were actually attending the Conservative Political Action Conference, which was held at the same time as their slated absences. In response, the Campaign for Accountability, an ethics watchdog group, filed a complaint with the House Committee on Ethics and requested an investigation into Green and the other lawmakers.
In August 2022, Business Insider reported that Green had violated the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act of 2012, a federal transparency and conflict-of-interest law, by failing to properly disclose a purchase of stock in NGL Energy Partners worth between $100,000 and $250,000.
In a closed-door GOP meeting in 2024, Green called Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas "a reptile with no balls."
On February 14, 2024, Green announced that he would not run for re-election, but he reversed this decision on February 29.
On July 29, 2024, Green was announced as one of seven Republican members of a bipartisan task force investigating the attempted assassination of Donald Trump.

== Political positions ==


=== Abortion ===
Green opposes abortion. In a 2019 op-ed, he wrote, "modern science has revealed that mother and baby are, in fact, two separate persons—long before the baby is born" and argued that "a child becomes a child at conception".


=== Climate change ===
Green has expressed skepticism about the scientific consensus on climate change. During a town hall meeting, he acknowledged that carbon dioxide levels are increasing but questioned whether they are causing global warming. He stated, "I’m not yet convinced that the science is proving that we’re warming, but I am very convinced that we have aerial fertilization going on, and if we continue to cut trees in Brazil and other places, we’re going to hurt ourselves, and then we will have warming." He also highlighted concerns about deforestation's role in climate change.


=== Creationism ===
Green rejects the theory of evolution, which is consensus in biology; in a 2015 lecture he used creationist reasoning such as "irreducible complexity".


=== 2020 election ===
In December 2019, Green voted against the articles of impeachment in the first impeachment of Donald Trump.
In December 2020, Green was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden prevailed over incumbent Donald Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.


=== Vaccines ===
In 2018, as a congressman-elect, Green said at a constituent meeting, "there is some concern that the rise in autism is the result of the preservatives that are in our vaccines", a claim that has been repeatedly debunked by scientific studies and rejected by medical organizations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics.


=== 2024 Republican primary ===
Green was named as part of the Trump campaign's Tennessee leadership team.


=== Israel-Palestine conflict ===
Green voted to support Israel following the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.


=== Veterans ===
The PACT ACT which expanded VA benefits to veterans exposed to toxic chemicals during their military service, received a "nay" from Green. Regarding cannabis, despite lobbying from VSOs such as the DAV Green also voted against 2022 MORE Act.


== Personal life ==
Green and his wife, Camie, have two children. For most of his tenure in the state senate, he lived in Ashland City, in Cheatham County, south of Clarksville and west of Nashville. He has since moved to Clarksville.
In August 2024 Green filed for a divorce from his wife of nearly 36 years citing irreconcilable differences. In a text message circulated among House Republicans, his wife later accused him of having an affair with a younger woman working as a political reporter for Axios. However, she later admitted to misidentifying the woman after receiving a cease and desist letter from the company. The actual woman involved anonymously confirmed the affair to Politico in an effort to clear the reporter's name.

David Frank Kustoff ( KUST-off; born October 8, 1966) is an American politician and attorney serving as the United States representative from Tennessee's 8th congressional district. The district includes the bulk of West Tennessee, but most of its population is in the eastern part of the Memphis area, including the eastern fourth of Memphis itself. From 2006 to 2008, Kustoff served as a United States Attorney for the Western District of Tennessee. He is one of three Jewish Republicans in Congress, alongside Max Miller and Craig Goldman.


== Early life, education, and career ==
David Frank Kustoff was born in Memphis on October 8, 1966, and raised in the Memphis area. He graduated from Memphis's White Station High School in 1985. Kustoff attended the University of Memphis, graduating Omicron Delta Kappa and with a bachelor's degree in business administration in 1989. He then attended the Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law, graduating in 1992.
In 1998, Kustoff opened a law firm with Jim Strickland, whom he met at the University of Memphis. Both became active in Tennessee politics; Strickland was elected mayor of Memphis in 2015.


== Political career ==
Kustoff became active in politics during the 1990s, when he chaired the Republican Party of Shelby County. He served as George W. Bush's campaign chair in Tennessee during the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections. On August 8, 2002, Kustoff was named campaign chair for Lamar Alexander's 2002 Senate campaign. In December 2002, he criticized Senate minority leader Trent Lott after Lott praised Strom Thurmond for the harm that it would do to Republican outreach to minorities.
In 2002, Representative Ed Bryant announced that he would not seek reelection in Tennessee's 7th congressional district, which at the time included Kustoff's home in eastern Memphis, and would instead run in the senatorial election. On April 3, Kustoff announced that he would seek the Republican nomination to succeed Bryant. He lost the Republican primary to state senator Marsha Blackburn, who won with a plurality of 40.32%. Kustoff finished second with 20.24% of the vote and performed the best in the Memphis area, but two other Memphians split that region's vote. During the primary campaign Kustoff said he had an A+ rating from the National Rifle Association of America (NRA); in fact, the NRA had never rated him. Kustoff had filled out a questionnaire that the NRA said would have given him an A rating; Kustoff's campaign said that the candidate misspoke when he made his claim.


=== United States attorney ===
In 2006, President Bush nominated Kustoff as U.S. attorney for the Western District of Tennessee. The U.S. Senate confirmed him. During his tenure in office, Kustoff prosecuted the Operation Tennessee Waltz, after which John Ford, a prominent Tennessee politician, and others were sent to prison. Kustoff also worked to reduce crime in the Memphis area, joining a group of Memphis leaders and law enforcement officials called Operation Safe Community.
Kustoff resigned as U.S. attorney shortly before the 2008 election and returned to his private practice.


== U.S House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===
In February 2016, Stephen Fincher announced that he would not run for reelection in Tennessee's 8th congressional district. Kustoff announced his campaign in February; eastern Memphis had been shifted from the 7th to the 8th in the 2010 redistricting. Kustoff began to emerge from the crowded pack when he was endorsed by former Arkansas governor and Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee, who filmed ads for Kustoff and campaigned with him. He narrowly won the primary with a plurality of 27.45% of the vote. Shelby County commissioner George Flinn finished second with 23.08%. Kustoff faced Democratic nominee Rickey Hobson, a Delta Air Lines manager and Somerville, Tennessee resident, in the general election. He visited all 15 counties in the district and urged skeptical Republicans to support Donald Trump for the presidency. Kustoff defeated Hobson in the general election, but had effectively assured himself of a seat in Congress with his primary victory. The addition of the Memphis suburbs had turned the 8th into one of the most Republican districts in the nation; with a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+15, it was the most Republican district in the state outside East Tennessee.
In 2018 George Flinn ran against Kustoff for the Republican nomination and spent millions on his campaign, but Kustoff won with 56.00% of the vote to Flinn's 39.67%.


=== Caucus memberships ===
Republican Study Committee


== Political positions ==


=== Health care ===
Kustoff voted for the American Health Care Act in May 2017. "[O]ur current health care system is failing Tennesseans", he said. Later that month, a woman angrily confronted him about that vote during a town hall meeting at the University of Tennessee at Martin; after the meeting ended and Kustoff along with some of his staff got into their car, she gave chase and allegedly attempted to run them off the road, then confronted them again about Kustoff's vote, reportedly banging on the windows of his car in the process. Police later arrested her on a felony charge of reckless endangerment.


=== National security ===
Kustoff supported Trump's 2017 executive order to impose a temporary ban on entry to the U.S. to citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, saying, "I believe President Trump is putting American safety first, and I will encourage a long-term plan that is consistent with the values and compassion on which our great nation was founded."


=== LGBT rights ===
In December 2022, Kustoff was one of 169 Republicans who voted against the Respect for Marriage Act which would require all U.S states to recognize same-sex marriage. Kustoff voted against the Equality Act which would amend the original Civil Rights Act of 1964 to protect people from dicrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.


=== Texas v. Pennsylvania ===
In December 2020, Kustoff was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden prevailed over incumbent Donald Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.


== Personal life ==
Kustoff is Jewish and married to Roberta Kustoff, who is also a lawyer at the Kustoff and Strickland Firm. They have two children. They live in Germantown, an eastern suburb of Memphis.
He and Max Miller are the only two Republican Jewish members of the House of Representatives.
Kustoff served on the board of directors of BankTennessee and as a member of the Tennessee Higher Education Commission.

Daniel Reed Crenshaw (born March 14, 1984) is an American politician and former United States Navy SEAL officer serving as the U.S. representative for Texas's 2nd congressional district since 2019. He is a member of the Republican Party.
Crenshaw was a commissioned officer in the U.S. Navy, and served on SEAL Team 3 in the War in Afghanistan, reaching the rank of lieutenant commander. He was wounded in action during his third deployment, losing his right eye to an improvised explosive device. He served as a legislative assistant to Representative Pete Sessions, and was elected to Congress in 2018.


== Early life and education ==
Born to American parents in Aberdeen, Scotland, Dan Crenshaw grew up in Katy, Texas. His mother Susan died of cancer when he was ten years old. His father, Jim Crenshaw, is a petroleum engineer who worked abroad, and Crenshaw spent time growing up in Ecuador and Colombia, developing proficiency in Spanish. In 2002, he graduated from Colegio Nueva Granada in Bogotá, Colombia.
After high school, Crenshaw returned to the United States and attended Tufts University, graduating in 2006 with a Bachelor of Arts in international relations and a minor in physics. After a decade of military service, he studied public administration at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government, receiving a Master of Public Administration in 2017. He worked as a military legislative assistant for U.S. representative Pete Sessions.


== Military service ==
While at Tufts, Crenshaw joined the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps and received an officer's commission in the U.S. Navy after graduation. He received orders to Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL training (BUD/S) at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado. After six months of training, Crenshaw graduated with BUD/S class 264. He completed SEAL qualification training in June 2008 and received the 1130 designator as a Naval Special Warfare Officer, entitled to wear the Special Warfare Insignia. Crenshaw served for ten years and five tours of duty, reaching the rank of lieutenant commander. His first deployment was to Fallujah, Iraq, where he joined SEAL Team Three. He was based out of Naval Amphibious Base Coronado in Coronado, California.
As a Navy SEAL, Crenshaw was awarded two Bronze Star Medals, one with "V" device, the Purple Heart, and the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal with valor. He medically retired from military service in 2016 with the rank of lieutenant commander.
Crenshaw lost his right eye in 2012 during his third deployment when he was hit by an IED explosion in Afghanistan's Helmand Province. The blast destroyed his eye, and he required surgery to save the vision in his left eye. He remained in the Navy for four years after the injury, and served his fourth and fifth tours of duty in Bahrain and South Korea.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 2018 ====

In 2018, Crenshaw ran for the United States House of Representatives in Texas's 2nd congressional district, which includes northern and western Houston, including Kingwood, Humble, Atascocita, Spring, and the Rice University area, to succeed the retiring Ted Poe. He announced his candidacy in November 2017. Crenshaw credited national security analyst John Noonan for encouraging him to run for Congress. In a February 2018 interview, he said that border security and immigration reform would be two of his campaign issues.
Crenshaw and Kevin Roberts advanced from the nine-candidate first round of the Republican primary election to face each other in a runoff election; Crenshaw received 155 votes more than Kathaleen Wall, a candidate backed by Senator Ted Cruz and Governor Greg Abbott. The lead-up to the runoff election was contentious. A super PAC funded by Roberts' brother-in-law, Mark Lanier, focused on Crenshaw's 2015 criticisms of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump, despite Roberts having also been critical of Trump in the past. The ads also compared Crenshaw's policy proposals to those of President Barack Obama and Senator Bernie Sanders. Gaining the endorsement of Senator Tom Cotton, Crenshaw received national attention, appearing in print and television, including on Laura Ingraham's show on Fox Business.
Crenshaw won the runoff to advance to the November general election. On November 6, he defeated Democratic nominee Todd Litton, 52.8% to 45.6%. After the election, Crenshaw called for the depoliticization of comedy and sports and expressed a desire that political rhetoric be toned down.
On the November 3 episode of Saturday Night Live, comedian Pete Davidson joked about the appearances of multiple candidates in the 2018 midterm elections and described Crenshaw as looking like a "hit man in a porno movie" while adding that he lost his eye in "war or whatever". The joke received widespread criticism and on the following episode, Davidson and Crenshaw appeared on air together. Davidson offered an apology, which Crenshaw accepted. Crenshaw also used the segment to advocate for veterans' issues. Crenshaw and others have speculated that the joke may have helped him win, as well as aided later fundraising. 
Two years later, Davidson rescinded his apology, saying he had been "forced to apologize", adding that "I didn't think I did anything wrong." In response, Crenshaw called it "a little sad" that Davidson "can't stop thinking" about him.


==== 2020 ====

Crenshaw was reelected in 2020, defeating Democratic nominee Sima Ladjevardian from Houston, Texas with 55.6% of the vote to Ladjevardian's 42.8%. During the campaign, he spent over $11 million through October 16, 2020, making it one of the most expensive Congressional races in the country.


==== 2022 ====

Crenshaw was reelected in 2022, defeating Democratic nominee Robin Fulford by 66% to 34%.


==== 2024 ====

Crenshaw was reelected in 2024, defeating Democratic nominee Peter Filler.


=== Tenure ===

Crenshaw spoke at the 2020 Republican National Convention on August 26, 2020.
The Inspector General of the Department of Veterans Affairs implicated Crenshaw and V.A. Secretary Robert Wilkie in a 2020 report as having engaged in a campaign of disparagement toward a female veteran who reported sexual assault to the Navy. Crenshaw said, "The Democrats created this narrative".
In March 2021, The Daily Beast reported that Crenshaw had violated the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act of 2012, a federal transparency and conflict-of-interest law, by failing to properly disclose stock trades that he made in March 2020.
Crenshaw is publicly critical of the Freedom Caucus, whom he regards as divisive "performance artists" for constantly attacking moderate Republicans.


=== Committee assignment ===
Committee on Energy and Commerce
Subcommittee on Environment and Climate Change

Previous assignments:

Committee on the Budget

=== Caucus membership ===
Republican Study Committee


== Political positions ==


=== Abortion ===
Crenshaw opposes abortion. In 2019, he received a 0% rating from NARAL Pro-Choice America and a 100% rating from the National Right to Life Committee. He has said that "life starts at conception", that he believes Roe v. Wade was a "bad precedent to set", and that abortion rights "should be decided by the states". When the Supreme Court decision Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization overturned Roe, Crenshaw released the statement: "Historic. The issue goes back to the states, back to the people."


=== Gun rights ===
Crenshaw opposes gun control measures, including bans on semi-automatic firearms. In response to the shootings in Dayton and El Paso, he suggested exploring red flag laws as a possible solution to gun violence. But after the 2022 Robb Elementary school shooting, Crenshaw partially retreated from the idea, arguing that such laws should be discussed at state level rather than nationally, saying, "What you're essentially trying to do with a red flag law is enforce the law before the law has been broken, and that's a really difficult thing to do" and "if there's such a threat that they're threatening somebody with a weapon already, then they've already broken the law, so why do you need this other law?" Crenshaw has also said that raising the legal age to purchase a firearm to 21 is ineffective but supports expanding background checks to include juvenile criminal history.
In 2020 and 2022, Crenshaw received an "A" rating and endorsement from the NRA Political Victory Fund.


=== COVID-19 pandemic ===
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Crenshaw said that Democrats and the media were exaggerating the threat. He was a high-profile defender of Trump's response to the pandemic. He did not wear face masks consistently in settings advised by health experts and mandated by Governor Greg Abbott.
Crenshaw argued that FDA regulations impeded the development of COVID-19 tests.


=== Healthcare ===
Crenshaw favors repealing the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), describing it as an "unmitigated disaster". During his 2018 campaign, he advocated allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, becoming one of a handful of Republicans to endorse what was primarily a progressive idea. By 2019, however, Crenshaw had retreated from this position.
On May 24, 2019, Crenshaw co-sponsored a bill to extend time limits for claims under the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund Act.
Crenshaw has introduced legislation to fund research into the use of psychedelic therapy as a treatment option for military members suffering from PTSD and traumatic brain injuries.


=== Donald Trump ===

According to Politico, Crenshaw "voted with Donald Trump most of the time but isn't a loyalist. He's a stalwart conservative willing to criticize other conservatives."
Although Crenshaw had criticized some of Trump's statements in a 2015 Facebook post, he became a "staunch defender" of Trump after the 2016 election. He voted against both articles of impeachment the House of Representatives brought against Trump in 2019.
In 2020, Crenshaw defended the Trump administration's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In a video Trump retweeted, Crenshaw rebutted criticisms that the Trump administration had been slow in responding to the virus.
Crenshaw spoke at the 2020 Republican National Convention, calling the United States "a country of heroes." He was one of few convention speakers not to mention Trump.
After Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election and Trump refused to concede, Crenshaw was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the election. The lawsuit claimed that the four swing states that Biden won had taken "unconstitutional actions", and invoked baseless claims of fraud. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.
Crenshaw criticized the 2021 U.S. Capitol attack perpetrated by Trump supporters, and said that Trump should have ordered the rioters to stop. During the siege, he urged the protesters to "Stop this bullshit right now" on Twitter. Crenshaw condemned the rioting and some of his fellow congressional Representatives for "saying constantly this is our time to fight." While not naming any politicians, Crenshaw stated they were "lying to millions" and scattered when there was an actual threat to the Capitol. He deemed efforts to fight the Electoral College vote certification unconstitutional, and voted against the objections to the electoral vote in both Arizona and Pennsylvania, but defended Senators Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley against allegations that they stoked the riot. Crenshaw voted against the Trump impeachment on January 13, 2021. In a statement, Crenshaw said that while Trump's words had encouraged "unconstitutional theories that risk the stability of our nation", he had voted against the second impeachment because he felt Democrats had "rushed" the process and that impeaching a president who only had seven days left in office would serve little purpose and inflame further tensions.
After Liz Cheney was censured for voting to impeach Trump, Crenshaw asserted in an interview that the Republican Party needed "to move on" from claims the 2020 election was stolen, but also accused the media of continuing to weaponize the issue, arguing both were ignoring larger issues such as the economy, the COVID pandemic and illegal immigration. He also said, "I do not think Trump is the devil, and I won't say that; I don't think he's Jesus either." Crenshaw also supported Representative Adam Kinzinger, who sat on the January 6 select committee and is publicly critical of Trump, and criticized far-right members of the Freedom Caucus as "performance artists" and "grifters".
In 2022, on his podcast Hold These Truths, Crenshaw criticized Republicans who contested the results of the 2020 presidential election, saying of their efforts, "It was always a lie. The whole thing was always a lie. And it was a lie meant to rile people up".


=== Election reform ===
In 2019, Crenshaw voiced opposition to the For the People Act of 2019, saying it would "limit free speech drastically". He also said the bill would use taxpayer money to "legalize" the kind of electoral fraud that he alleges occurred on the Republican side in the 2018 election for North Carolina's District 9. PolitiFact rated Crenshaw's assertion about the North Carolina race "false", adding, "nothing in the bill that expands who can collect absentee ballots, allows people to fill out ballots for others, or loosens witnessing procedures for absentee ballots", as happened in that election. Crenshaw argued that the bill did not include a federal ban on ballot harvesting, and supported the American Civil Liberties Union's opposition to it over new campaign contribution revisions.


=== Environment ===

During Crenshaw's 2018 campaign, his website made brief mention of global warming, applauding Trump for withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accords. Crenshaw called the agreement "costly and meaningless", virtue signaling, and bad policy. He also said, "We must use our money to develop better infrastructure." In 2018, Crenshaw called for a debate on the causes of climate change, adding, "We can't start off the conversation saying the climate is settled. The right way to have this conversation is to actually listen to what the science says on both sides."
In 2019, Crenshaw said, "climate change is occurring and that man-made emissions play a part in that. What isn't clear is how our actions will serve to reverse that warming trend, and what the cost-benefit outcome would be. Regardless, we should continue pursuing new green energy solutions that lessen our impact on the environment and create cleaner air and water." In 2020, he criticized solar and wind energy as "silly solutions" that "don't work," and instead advocated expanding nuclear energy and carbon capture technology.
During the 2021 Texas power crisis, Crenshaw argued that the Green New Deal would lead to similar crises.


=== Immigration ===
In 2016, Crenshaw harshly criticized then-candidate Trump's "insane rhetoric" toward Muslims and "hateful" speech. During Crenshaw's 2018 campaign, he defended Trump's proposal to build a border wall on the Mexico–United States border. In a May 2019 appearance on The View, he claimed that 80%–90% of asylum seeker requests "don't have a valid asylum claim"; news outlet PolitiFact called the claim "false", writing that although only 20% to 30% of asylum claims are granted, "experts said there are many reasons why cases might be closed or requests might be denied, regardless of the merits of a claim." In 2021, Crenshaw accused the Biden administration of provoking a crisis on the southern border by having a moratorium on deportations and reversing Trump's policies on asylum and illegal immigration. He has also argued that Mexican drug cartels have fueled illegal immigration by taking advantage of the U.S. asylum process to smuggle people into the country.
Crenshaw supports enforcing physical barriers and implementing technology at the southern border to prevent illegal immigration. He has also expressed a belief that people who try to enter the U.S. illegally "aren't bad people" but "they are breaking the law, and they're contributing to an unsustainable system" and are "cutting in front of the line of all the legal immigrants."
Crenshaw voted for the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020, which authorizes DHS to nearly double the available H-2B visas for the remainder of FY 2020. He also voted for the Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1158), which effectively prohibits ICE from cooperating with Health and Human Services to detain or remove illegal alien sponsors of unaccompanied alien children (UACs).


=== Social issues ===
Despite having previously expressing support for the legalization of same-sex marriage, Crenshaw voted against the Respect for Marriage Act, even after amendments allowing religious exemptions. Calling same-sex marriage a "tough issue", Crenshaw believes that government should not be involved in regulating marriage. In 2015, he took issue with people trying to suggest Christianity is as shocking and as violent as Islam, saying, "the worst thing modern Christianity stands for is anti-homosexual marriage, which is a far cry from sex slaves, sharia law and beheadings."
In the case of a 7-year-old transgender child who was the subject of a custody battle between a supportive mother and an unsupportive father, Crenshaw opined in favor of the father. The child, who had identified as a girl from the age of 3 years old, was seeking a gender transition. (At this age, transitioning involves a social transition, where the child presents themselves in line with their identified gender; it does not involve medical interventions such as cross-sex hormones or surgeries). Following a judge's decision to grant custody to the mother, Crenshaw called the outcome "heart-breaking" and added, "[a] 7-year-old can't possibly make this decision or understand it. Parents should know better. I hope this father receives the public support he needs."
Crenshaw opposes federal funding to "subsidize college in general", but supports it in cases of vocational training. He opposes cancel culture, and athletes kneeling during the national anthem. He called Senator Tammy Duckworth unpatriotic for wanting a discussion on which statues to remove, including those of George Washington.


=== Foreign policy ===
Crenshaw supports cooperation with and support for Israel. During some of his public appearances, he has been targeted by anti-semitic white nationalists, known as Groypers, for his pro-Israel views. He voted to provide Israel with support following 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.
In 2019, Crenshaw co-sponsored a resolution opposing Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, saying that it would embolden the Turkish military's assault on the Kurdish forces. He supported Trump's decision to kill Iranian major general Qasem Soleimani.
In April 2020, Crenshaw and Senator Tom Cotton introduced a bill that would allow civil suits against foreign states in incidents related to injury or death. The legislation came in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and calls for the Chinese government to be held accountable for "allow[ing] this virus to spread".
In 2022, Crenshaw voiced support for a $40 billion aid package to Ukraine. Fox News political commentator Tucker Carlson criticized him for this, calling Crenshaw "Eyepatch McCain"—a remark that itself drew much criticism.

In April 2021, Crenshaw suffered a detached retina in his functional left eye, undergoing emergency surgery. As he recovered, he expected to be virtually blind for about a month. He said, "I don't have a 'good eye,' but half a good eye."

Keith Alan Self (born March 20, 1953) is an American politician who has been the United States representative for Texas's 3rd congressional district since 2023. He is a member of the Republican Party. From 2007 until 2018, he was the county judge for Collin County.


== Early life and education ==
Self was born in 1953 at a military hospital in Philadelphia and graduated from Tascosa High School in Amarillo, Texas. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering from the United States Military Academy in 1975.
 Self is a life member of the National Rifle Association of America.
Self is Protestant.


== Early career ==
Self served in the United States Army from 1975 to 1999. He was a member of the Army Special Forces and Army Rangers. He was deployed to Qatar, Egypt, Germany, Afghanistan, and Belgium. He was a candidate to replace retiring U.S. Representative Dick Armey in 2002, narrowly missing the runoff by 93 votes to future Representative Michael C. Burgess. He was recalled to active duty from 2002 to 2003, retiring as a lieutenant colonel. Self was then elected as the county judge for Collin County, Texas, serving three terms from 2007 to 2018. He was a candidate for Texas's 3rd congressional district in the March 2022 Republican primary, finishing second to incumbent Van Taylor and advancing to a May runoff. After the primary, Taylor announced that he would end his congressional campaign amid accusations of marital infidelity, giving Self the nomination. Self won the November general election.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Tenure ===
On January 3, 2023, at the beginning of the 118th Congress, Self voted for Jim Jordan and later for Byron Donalds to be the U.S. House Speaker, in rebuke of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. "I love the new [U.S. House] rules. I’m looking for somebody that will enforce them", Self said. In the 12th round of voting, Self changed his vote to McCarthy, saying "we are making progress... This will change this House, let’s be very clear". Self was one of 15 Republicans to change their votes. McCarthy finally won the speakership on the 15th vote, held early in the morning on Saturday, January 7, with Self voting in favor.
As a consequence of the delay in selecting a new speaker, Self was formally sworn in as a member of the House of Representatives in the early morning of January 7, 2023, despite the 118th Congress convening on January 3.


=== Committee assignment ===
Committee on Foreign Affairs
Subcommittee on Europe
Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere
Committee on Veteran's Affair
Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs
Subcommittee on Technology Modernization


=== Caucasus membership ===
Republican Study Committee


== Political positions ==


=== 2020 election ===
The Washington Post listed Self as a 2020 presidential election denier.


=== District priorities ===
During his 2022 midterm election campaign, Self listed his priorities for his district as: "Growth challenges such as transportation, proliferation of drag queen shows that target children (I returned a PAC check to a business that sponsored one) and drugs flowing into our area across the border".


=== Fiscal policy ===
Self has said that he considers the growth of U.S. national debt "the existential threat that our nation faces today".
Self was among the 71 Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 in the House.


=== Gun violence ===
On May 6, 2023, a gunman used an AR-15 style rifle in an outlet mall shooting that killed eight and wounded seven in Allen, Texas, within Self's district. In the aftermath of the attack, Self was criticized for characterizing people who say that prayer alone will not to stop mass shootings as "people that don't believe in an almighty God, who is absolutely in control of our lives". He followed up by saying that he did not want to discuss politics so soon after a mass shooting; that Allen remains a "very safe area"; and that calls for additional regulation of AR-15 style rifles, including raising the allowable purchasing age, are “a knee-jerk reaction that does not stop criminals.” Self advocated for arming school staff members with guns and having an armed presence in the public, stating that prayer and full funding of mental health programs are a better remedy for mass shootings than gun control. Shannon Watts, the founder of the advocacy group Moms Demand Action, responded: "Faith without works is dead. Prayers without action are empty."
The shooter, Mauricio Martinez Garcia, had enlisted in the U.S. Army in June 2008, but never completed basic training: he was terminated after 3 months due to mental health concerns. Because this was an administrative separation, rather than a punitive discharge, Garcia's termination by the Army would not show up on the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. On May 11, commenting on Garcia's military service, Self characterized him as "exactly the kind of person we’re trying to keep weapons out of the hands of" and said that Garcia's ability to buy guns legally was a loophole that he intends to fix; however, Self denied that he was discussing a red flag law.

Patrick Edward Fallon (born December 19, 1967) is an American businessman and politician. A member of the Republican Party, he has been the U.S. representative for Texas's 4th congressional district since 2021. Fallon was also a member of the Texas House of Representatives for the 106th district from 2013 to 2019 and represented the  30th district of the Texas Senate from 2019 to 2021.
Fallon is a member of the new House Department of Government Efficiency Committee. 


== Early life and education ==
Fallon was born in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. Both his parents were public school teachers, and he was raised in suburban areas, growing up in the largest city in Berkshire County.  
Fallon earned his bachelor's degree in government and international relations from the University of Notre Dame, where he played varsity football under coach Lou Holtz and claims to have been part of the 1988 national championship team.   He ran a t-shirt business as a student and participated in campus political activities. He was a cadet in the Air Force Reserve Officers Training Corps and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Air Force upon graduation.  He then served in the Air Force for four years, during which he received the Air Force Achievement Medal.


== Career ==
After college, Fallon relocated to Denton County, Texas, in the early 1990s. He is the president and chief executive officer of Virtus Apparel, a company that specializes in clothing of military and patriotic design. Based in Prosper, Texas, it has a dozen national locations and about 100 total employees.


=== Politics ===
In 2009, Fallon launched a campaign that netted him 57% of the vote to defeat three opponents for an at-large seat on the Frisco City Council. In the Denton County portion of Frisco, which consists of about one-third of the voters in House District 106, Fallon polled 65% of the vote. In his first year on the city council, Fallon voted against a tax rate increase. In 2010, he voted against a city budget that would have increased the municipal debt. In May 2011, his council colleagues selected him to serve as mayor pro tem.
In 2012 Fallon won the Republican nomination in the reconfigured District 106, in which incumbent Republican Rodney Anderson of Grand Prairie did not run. Instead, Anderson unseated incumbent Republican Linda Harper-Brown in the 2014 primary election in neighboring District 105. Fallon won the general election on November 6, 2012, with 41,785 votes (83.2%) to Libertarian Party nominee Rodney Caston's 8,455 (16.8%). Fallon faced no Democratic Party opponent in the election.
Fallon co-authored a 2013 Texas law that allows students and employees of independent school districts to say "Merry Christmas" rather than the secular "Happy Holidays".
Fallon ran unopposed for the Republican nomination in 2014 and defeated Democrat Lisa Osterholt and Libertarian Rodney Caston in the general election with 24,419 votes, almost 70% of the total. In the 2016 Republican primary, Fallon defeated challenger Trent Trubenbach with 16,106 votes (82.9%) to Tubenbach's 3,327 (17.1%). He won the general election with 80.8% of the vote.
In July 2017, Fallon announced that he would challenge incumbent state Senator Craig Estes for the Republican nomination in Senate District 30. Fallon defeated Estes and Nocona businessman Craig Carter in the primary on March 6, 2018, with 53,881 votes (62%). In the November 6 general election, Fallon defeated Democratic nominee Kevin Lopez with 233,949 votes (73.9%) to Lopez's 82,449 (26.1%). Fallon served on the House committees on Human Services and Technology.


=== Legislative positions ===
Fallon defended his "Merry Christmas" law in an appearance on David Barton's WallBuilders Live radio program, telling co-host Rick Green, a former member of the Texas House from Hays County in suburban Austin, that those offended by public schools hosting Christmas parties should examine their own hearts to evaluate their attitudes. Both Fallon and Green said that no citizen has a constitutional right "not to be offended". Fallon vowed to make T-shirts with a Christmas theme for pupils to wear on the day before the holiday break.
In 2013 Fallon supported Texas House Bill 2, a bill that would ban abortion after 20 weeks of gestation and require abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. The measure passed the House, 96–49. These issues brought forth an unsuccessful filibuster in the Texas State Senate by Senator Wendy R. Davis. Parts of the bill were later deemed unconstitutional and struck down by the Supreme Court of the United States in Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt. The Texas Right to Life Committee rated Fallon 100% favorable.
Fallon opposed the bill to establish a taxpayer-funded breakfast program for public schools; the measure passed the House, 73–58. He co-sponsored legislation to provide marshals for school security as a separate law-enforcement entity. He co-sponsored the successful bill to extend the franchise tax exemption to certain small businesses. He voted to require testing for narcotics of those individuals receiving unemployment compensation.
Fallon co-sponsored the measure to forbid the state from engaging in the enforcement of federal regulations of firearms. He co-sponsored legislation to allow college and university officials to carry concealed weapons on campus and in vehicles in the name of security. He voted to reduce the time required to obtain a concealed-carry permit. Fallon voted for term limits for certain state officials. To protect election integrity, Fallon supported legislation to forbid an individual from turning in multiple ballots.


==== Veterans ====
The PACT ACT which expanded VA benefits to veterans exposed to toxic chemicals during their military service, received a "nay" from Fallon. Regarding cannabis, despite lobbying from VSOs such as the DAV, Fallon also voted against the 2022 MORE Act.


=== Comments on the LGBTQ community ===
In 2018, Fallon was criticized for his remarks about state representative Mary González, an openly pansexual woman, while delivering a speech to the local Wichita County Republican Women's group. The El Paso Times quoted Fallon:

"You can’t be gay anymore. It’s like the whole alphabet soup now — lesbian, transgender, bisexual, questioning. There’s something called pansexual."
Fallon later apologized, saying, "It was an innocent little comment about mocking the labeling, not a person."


=== Interest group ratings ===
In 2015 Fallon was named one of "The 3 Worst North Texas Legislators" by D Magazine, which wrote, "Fallon has a lawyerlike relationship with the truth" and was "vindictive, and he’ll say anything to get what he wants".
By contrast, Phyllis Schlafly's Eagle Forum, managed in Texas by Cathie Adams, a former state chairman of the Texas Republican Party and a Fallon supporter, rated Fallon 95%. The Young Conservatives of Texas scored him 92%. The Texas League of Conservation Voters rated him 25%; Environment Texas, 28%. Texans for Fiscal Responsibility rated Fallon 98%; the Texas Association of Business, 80%. The NRA Political Victory Fund rated him "A+".


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 2020 ====

In May 2020, Fallon launched a campaign for Texas's 4th congressional district to replace former U.S. representative John Ratcliffe, who resigned to become Director of National Intelligence. On August 8, 2020, Fallon was selected to replace Ratcliffe on the November ballot by the 18 county Republican Party chairs and precinct chairs in the district, winning the nomination with 82 votes to his nearest opponent's 34. Fallon faced Democrat Russell Foster in the November general election. According to The Texas Tribune, the district was so heavily gerrymandered that the county Republican chairs effectively chose Ratcliffe's successor when they chose Fallon to replace him as the Republican nominee.
As expected, Fallon won the general election in a landslide, with 75% of the vote to Foster's 22%. When he took office, he was only the sixth person to represent this district since its creation in 1903.


=== Tenure ===
On January 6, 2021, Fallon, along with 147 of his fellow congressional Republicans, voted to block certification of the results for President-elect Joe Biden's 2020 United States presidential election.
Fallon voted to include provisions for drafting women in the National Defense Authorization Act of 2022.
In March 2023, Fallon was one of 26 Republicans sitting on the House Oversight and Accountability Committee who refused to join their Democratic counterparts in signing a letter denouncing white supremacy and racist conspiracy theories.
Fallon was among the 71 Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 in the House.
Fallon voted to provide Israel with support following 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.
On November 13, 2023, it was reported that Fallon had filed to run for the state senate seat he once held, opening up his congressional seat in the 2024 election. Fallon reversed course the next day, even after his potential return to the Texas Senate received an endorsement from Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, and announced that he would instead seek reelection to his current House seat after all.
On July 29, 2024, Fallon was announced as one of seven Republican members of a bipartisan task force investigating the attempted assassination of Donald Trump.

=== Investigation ===
In February 2022, the Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) board filed a report stating that there was "substantial reason to believe" that Fallon had violated a federal stock law. The House Committee on Ethics released that report on May 31, 2022, indicating that it was investigating Fallon over repeated reporting violations of the STOCK Act, enacted in 2012 to prevent insider trading using non-public information by members of Congress and other government employees. Members of Congress are required to report any stock transaction over $1,000 within 45 days. Violations are subject to a $200 fine.
The OCE report stated that during the first half of 2021, Fallon filed late reports representing as much as $17.53 million in trades. An OCE review of his record began in the fall of 2021. Reports for trades made in December 2021 again missed the required filing date. The OCE report states, "Rep. Fallon produced a limited set of documents to the OCE and declined to interview with the OCE. This non-cooperation undermined the OCE's ability to verify Rep. Fallon's overall STOCK Act compliance and to fully assess the reasons for his late filings."
Fallon initially claimed he thought that reporting was required annually, as in the Texas legislature. On March 18, 2022, one of his lawyers, Kate Belinski, sent the OCE a letter insisting that Fallon's beliefs were "a common misconception, which, coupled with the overwhelming amount of information new members and their staff receive at the beginning of their terms, often results in inadvertent late disclosures." She insisted that Fallon had cooperated by providing the documents OCE requested. But the OCE report noted Fallon's "late disclosure of reportable transactions, which continued even after he was on notice of his STOCK Act filing obligations."


=== 2024 Republican primary ===
Fallon was named as part of the Trump campaign's Texas leadership team in March.


== Personal life ==
Fallon is married to Susan Kimberly Garner; they have two sons.
During his tenure in the state senate, Fallon lived in the Denton County portion of Prosper, which was just outside the 4th's boundaries. While candidates for the House are only constitutionally required to live in the state they wish to represent, longstanding convention holds that they live either in or reasonably close to the district they wish to represent. 
Fallon is a member of Holy Cross Catholic Church in The Colony. He is a donor to Dallas Baptist University, Frisco Family Services, and the Boys & Girls Clubs of America.

Morgan Joe Luttrell (born November 7, 1975) is an American politician, businessman, and military veteran serving as the U.S. representative for Texas's 8th congressional district since 2023. He is a member of the Republican Party.


== Early life and education ==
Born in Houston in 1975, Morgan Joe Luttrell has a twin brother, Marcus. He graduated from Willis High School. Luttrell earned a Bachelor of Science degree in psychology from Sam Houston State University in 2000 and a Master of Science in applied cognition neuroscience from the University of Texas at Dallas in 2016. He also has an executive certificate in professional leadership development from Harvard Business School.


== Early career ==
Luttrell is an adjunct professor at Sam Houston State University, of which he is an alumnus. He also teaches law enforcement leadership.
In 2019, Luttrell founded Trexxler Energy Solutions. He is also the founder of Stronos Industries, which provides recyclable and biodegradable campaign signs.


=== Military service ===
Luttrell served as a United States Navy SEAL. He volunteered and received orders for Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL training (BUD/S) at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado in 2001. After months of training, Luttrell graduated from BUD/S class 237. After BUD/S, he completed advanced training courses including parachute training at Basic Airborne School, cold weather combat training in Kodiak, Alaska, and six months of SEAL Qualification Training (SQT) in Coronado, California. Luttrell received the Navy Enlisted Classification (NEC) 5326 as a Combatant Swimmer (SEAL), entitled to wear the Special Warfare Insignia. In 2007, he was commissioned as a Ensign after completing Officer Candidate School and received the 1130 designator as a Naval Special Warfare Officer. He served as a SEAL for 7 years until being medically retired in 2014 for a severe traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury he sustained in a helicopter crash in 2009. Luttrell travelled to Rosarito, Mexico to obtain psychedelic therapy (ibogaine and 5-MeO-DMT) for his injuries, including "hyperaggression" in civilian life; he described the treatments as having "profound" results, with "it [being] like 20 years of therapy in three days."


=== Early political involvement ===

From 2017 to 2019, Luttrell was a senior advisor to Secretary Rick Perry in the United States Department of Energy. At the Energy Department, Luttrell worked to keep U.S. energy industry globally competitive through the Artificial Intelligence and Technologies Office.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 2022 ====
In 2021, Luttrell filed to run as a Republican for Texas's 8th congressional district in the 2022 election to succeed retiring incumbent Kevin Brady.
During his campaign, Luttrell was supported by Rick Perry, Congressman Dan Crenshaw (also a former Navy SEAL), House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, the Congressional Leadership Fund, and the American Patriots PAC, which was founded by McCarthy allies. He garnered some notoriety from his brother Marcus, a veteran and the author of the memoir Lone Survivor. In total, there were 11 candidates in the Republican primary, but Luttrell and Christian Collins, a conservative activist, were identified as the primary contenders since they both received significant political endorsements. Collins was supported by U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, the House Freedom action fund, and avid Trump supporters such as Marjorie Taylor Greene and Madison Cawthorn. The Texas Tribune described the race as "a tense proxy war, with some of the best-known Republicans in Texas—and the country—split between two of the leading candidates." Luttrell has expressed support for Trump, but he did request and receive campaign funds from a political PAC run by Adam Kinzinger, a major critic of Trump. Luttrell and Collins ran on similar issues—securing the border, gun rights, and restricting abortion—but Collins attempted to portray himself as the more pro-Trump candidate, accusing Luttrell of "lining up with the establishment". Donald Trump did not make an endorsement in the race.
Luttrell won the Republican primary with 52.2% of the vote, avoiding a runoff with Collins, who placed second with 22%. The Democratic nominee in the general election was Laura Jones, the former Democratic Party chair of San Jacinto County.  Luttrell joined a lawsuit with several other congressional Republican candidates to remove Libertarian Party candidates, who are often perceived as threatening to Republican chances in tight elections, from the ballot. FiveThirtyEight rated Luttrell "very likely" to win the election. He was endorsed by the editorial board of the Houston Chronicle. On November 8, 2022, Luttrell defeated Jones in the general election by 68% to 31%.


==== 2024 ====
Luttrell was uncontested in the 2024 Republican primary, and he did again face Democratic nominee Laura Jones in the general election in which he was reelected.


=== Tenure ===
Luttrell assumed office on January 3, 2023 and was officially sworn in following the election of Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House on January 7. Along with Joaquin Castro and Troy Nehls, Luttrell was one of three twins from Texas in the 118th United States Congress. Luttrell was assigned to the House Armed Services Committee, serving on the Subcommittee on Cyber, Innovative Technologies and Information Systems and the Subcommittee on Intelligence and Special Operations.
Luttrell was among the 71 Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 in the House. He introduced an amendment, that was passed by the House, to a Department of Defense appropriations bill allocating $15 million to conduct clinical trials regarding the use of psychedelic therapy for veterans with traumatic brain injuries. In December 2023, Luttrell joined 13 of his colleagues in requesting an investigation into an attorney at the Office of General Counsel for the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs over their alleged antisemitic comments.

August Lee Pfluger ( FLOO-gər; born December 28, 1977) is an American politician and reserve military officer from the state of Texas. He is the U.S. representative for Texas's 11th congressional district. Pfluger succeeded fellow Republican Mike Conaway in 2021.


== Early life and education ==
Pfluger's four-times-great-grandfather, German immigrant Henry Pfluger Sr. (1803–1867), founded Pflugerville, Texas. His maternal grandfather, a member of the United States Army Air Corps in World War II, inspired Pfluger to become a pilot.
Born in Harris County in 1977, Pfluger attended Central High School in San Angelo, Texas, where he played quarterback for the school's football team. He is an Eagle Scout. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in political science from the United States Air Force Academy. Pfluger then earned a Master of Science degree in aeronautical science from Embry–Riddle Aeronautical University, a Master of Science in military and operations science from Air University, and a Master of Science in international business and policy from Georgetown University.


== Military service ==
Pfluger earned his commission to the United States Air Force in 2000. He served in active duty for 20 years, flying the Northrop T-38 Talon, F-15C Eagle and F-22A Raptor aircraft, He commanded 380th Expeditionary Operations Group in Al Dhafra Air Base He then deployed in Syria and Northern Iraq. During his service Pfluger earned several medal and awards including Meritorious Service Medal with three oak leaf clusters, Air Medal with one oak leaf clusters and Air Force Commendation Medal with one oak leaf clusters, He completed 2,000 hours including the over 300 combat hours and was progressively promoted to the rank of colonel.
Pfluger later served on the United States National Security Council (NSC) during Donald Trump's first presidency. He remained in the Air Force Reserve after leaving active duty. He also appeared briefly in the Fighter Pilot: Operation Red Flag IMAX film in 2004.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== 2020 election ===

Pfluger resigned from the NSC to run for the United States House of Representatives for Texas's 11th congressional district. Representative Mike Conaway, who had represented the district since its creation in 2005, was retiring after eight terms. Pfluger cleared 50% of the vote in a crowded 10-way Republican Party primary, enough to win the nomination in a single round. He faced Democratic nominee Jon Mark Hogg and Libertarian Wacey Alpha Cody in the November general election. However, with Republicans having a nearly 10-to-1 registration advantage in the district, Pfluger was heavily favored to win in November. Indeed, Hogg was only the fifth Democrat to run in the district since its creation in 2005.
As expected, Pfluger easily defeated Hogg in the general election.


=== Tenure ===
Pfluger took office on January 3, 2021. On January 6, the day of the storming of the United States Capitol, he and 146 of his fellow congressional Republicans voted to block certification of President-elect Joe Biden's 2020 victory, as part of the Trump-led effort to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election. Specifically, he voted against certifying Arizona's and Pennsylvania's electoral votes.
In August 2021, Business Insider reported that Pfluger had violated the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act of 2012, a federal transparency and conflict-of-interest law, by failing to properly disclose stock trades made by him or his wife worth between $10,007 and $150,000.
On July 18, 2023, he proposed a congressional non-binding resolution which stated that “the State of Israel is not a racist or apartheid state", that Congress rejects "all forms of antisemitism and xenophobia" and that “the United States will always be a staunch partner and supporter of Israel." It passed with support from 217 Republicans and 195 Democrats.
In March 2024, Pfluger, representative Don Davis, and a news reporter wrote an opinion piece in the Washington Examiner. The piece criticized the push by many members of Congress to condition U.S. aid to Israel.


==== Veterans ====
The PACT ACT which expanded VA benefits to veterans exposed to toxic chemicals during their military service, received a "nay" from Pfluger. Regarding cannabis, despite lobbying from VSOs such as the DAV Pfluger also voted against 2022 MORE Act.

After U.S. Representative Ron Paul of Texas's 14th congressional district decided to retire, nine Republicans ran in the newly redrawn district. Paul and Governor Rick Perry endorsed Weber. He ranked first with 28% of the vote. In the runoff, he defeated Pearland City Councilwoman Felicia Harris, 62%–37%. He faced former Congressman Nick Lampson in the general election; Lampson jumped into the race after the 14th had been redrawn to include much of the territory he had represented in Congress from 1997 to 2005. In the November 6 general election, Weber defeated Lampson, 53% to 45%. Based upon Weber's vote total, Larry Sabato's Crystal Ball named Weber one of its "Underachievers" because he received only 54% of the vote in his district while Mitt Romney received 59%.

Weber was reelected on November 8, 2016. He polled 160,631 votes (61.9%) to Democratic nominee Michael Cole's 99,054 (38.1%).


=== Tenure ===
In January 2014, during President Obama's State of the Union address, Weber in a tweet called Obama "Kommandant-In-Chef" [sic] and "the Socialist dictator." After the White House apologized for failing to send a higher-profile leader to a demonstration in Paris after the January 2015 terrorist attacks in that city, Weber tweeted, "Even Adolph [sic] Hitler thought it more important than Obama to get to Paris." Weber then wrote that he needed to "apologize to all those offended by my tweet". He did not delete his tweet made during the State of the Union address.

In 2015, Weber cosponsored a resolution to amend the Constitution to ban same-sex marriage. Weber also cosponsored a resolution disagreeing with the Supreme Court decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, which held that same-sex marriage bans violated the constitution.
In April 2015, Weber met with Aleksandr Torshin, the alleged handler for Russian spy Maria Butina, according to internal documents from Center for the National Interest.
The American Conservative Union gave him a 92% evaluation, Americans for Prosperity gave him a 94% evaluation, Campaign for Working Families, Concerned Women for America, and Faith and Freedom Coalition each gave him 100% evaluations, Conservative Review gave him a 73% evaluation, Eagle Forum gave him an 80% evaluation, National Journal gave him an 89% evaluation, and the John Birch Society gave him a 67% evaluation.
In December 2020, Weber was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated incumbent Donald Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a statement that called signing the amicus brief an act of "election subversion." She also reprimanded Weber and the other House members who supported the lawsuit: "The 126 Republican Members that signed onto this lawsuit brought dishonor to the House. Instead of upholding their oath to support and defend the Constitution, they chose to subvert the Constitution and undermine public trust in our sacred democratic institutions."
Weber is a supporter of efforts to impeach President Biden. In September 2021, Weber submitted a resolution to impeach Biden "for perpetuating a perception that Afghan security forces were winning the war against the Taliban." That same month, he also co-sponsored a resolution by Bob Gibbs to impeach Biden. In August 2021, Weber co-sponsored a resolution to impeach Alejandro Mayorkas, Biden's Secretary of Homeland Security.
Weber was among the 71 Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 in the House.

The bill was also introduced in the Senate.

Jodey Cook Arrington ( AIR-ring-tən; born March 9, 1972) is an American politician serving as the U.S. representative for Texas's 19th congressional district. The district includes a large slice of West Texas, centered around Lubbock and Abilene. He is a member of the Republican Party.
Arrington was a member of George W. Bush's gubernatorial and presidential administrations. He was named appointments manager for Governor Bush in 1996. In 2000, he was appointed Special Assistant to the President and Associate Director of Presidential Personnel. In December 2001, Donald E. Powell, the 18th chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, hired Arrington as the agency's chief of staff.
Arrington later served as deputy federal coordinator for the Office of the Federal Coordinator for Gulf Coast Rebuilding. In 2006, he left the coastal rebuilding office to return to his alma mater, Texas Tech University, as its system chief of staff and later vice chancellor for research and commercialization. Until his election to Congress, Arrington was the president of Scott Laboratories in Lubbock.


== Early life and education ==
Arrington, the son of Gene and Betty Arrington, was reared in Plainview. His father played basketball at Texas Tech, having lettered in 1958, 1959, and 1960 under coach Polk Robison. In high school, Arrington was a multi-sport athlete and a state-ranked tennis player.
After graduating from Plainview High School, Arrington attended Texas Tech, where he was a member of the Phi Delta Theta men's fraternity. He also walked on to the football team under Spike Dykes. He graduated in 1994 with a Bachelor of Arts in political science but remained at Texas Tech to pursue a Master of Public Administration degree, which he completed in 1997. In 2004, he earned a Certificate of International Business Management from the McDonough School of Business at Georgetown University.


== White House ==
After Bush was elected president in 2000, Arrington joined the White House as Special Assistant to the President and Associate Director of Presidential Personnel, where he served under Clay Johnson III. For the next year, Arrington briefed and made recommendations to the President, Vice President Dick Cheney, and Chief of Staff Andy Card. During his time in the Office of Presidential Personnel, he managed an executive search team that helped the office fill more than 5,000 executive-level, board, and commission positions. He specialized in energy, the environment, and natural resources appointments.


== Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ==
In late December 2001, at age 28, Arrington became one of the youngest chiefs of staff in the history of the FDIC, where he served under the 18th chair, Donald E. Powell. As Powell's chief of staff, he managed and oversaw the offices of the Chairman, Policy Development, and Public Affairs, all of which he reorganized to increase efficiency. In 2002, Arrington began chairing the FDIC Board Appeals Committee and served in Powell's place on the Audit Committee.


== Gulf Coast rebuilding ==
In 2005, in the wake of FEMA's response to Hurricane Katrina, President Bush established by executive order the Office of the Federal Coordinator for Gulf Coast Rebuilding. Bush appointed Don Powell as Federal Coordinator, who, in turn, appointed Arrington as Deputy Federal Coordinator and Chief Operating Officer. In this role, Arrington worked with the governors of the affected states, as well as military officials, local authorities and charitable organizations. Powell and Arrington were responsible for developing and executing the federal government's recovery efforts, as well as coordinating with local, state and federal officials. By the end of Arrington's first year in the Gulf Coast, he had aided Powell in the procurement and implementation of much of the $120 billion spent on infrastructure and assistance relief.


== Texas Tech ==
After a year in the Gulf Coast position, Arrington returned to Texas Tech to serve as its system chief of staff. The Tech System includes Texas Tech University, Texas Tech Health Sciences Center, Midwestern State University, and Angelo State University. He also served as the primary liaison to the vice-chancellors throughout the system.
In 2011, Arrington was named Vice Chancellor for Research and Commercialization at Texas Tech University System. During his seven-year tenure with the Texas Tech University System, Arrington chaired the Task Force for Enrollment Growth and was the chief architect of "Leading the Way", the strategic plan for the universities within the TTU System.
Arrington worked to secure the naming rights to the Laura W. Bush Institute for Women's Health for the university health sciences center. Since securing the naming rights in 2007, the institute has been responsible for raising hundreds of thousands of dollars for women's health care issues.


== Scott Laboratories ==
In 2014, Arrington became president of Scott Laboratories in Lubbock. As president of a healthcare innovation holding company, which includes a comprehensive health system, Arrington's primary role was to launch and grow new ventures and support new revenue opportunities at the health system.
Until his election to Congress, Arrington focused on developing a telehealth startup, launching an innovative insurance product, and establishing a digital marketing platform for the health system.


== U.S House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===
Arrington ran unsuccessfully in 2014 in a special election for the Texas State Senate District 28. He lost to fellow Republican Charles Perry, who still holds the seat.
With Representative Randy Neugebauer of Texas's 19th congressional district retiring in 2016, Arrington ran for his seat. Former Lubbock mayor Glen Robertson led a nine-candidate field in the March 1 primary election with 27,791 votes (26.7%), followed by Arrington's 26,980 (26%). In third place was Michael Bob Starr, the former commander of Dyess Air Force Base, who led handily in Abilene and received 22,256 votes (21.4%). Laredo surgeon Donald R. May finished fourth with 9,592 votes (9.2%).
In the May 24 runoff election, Arrington defeated Robertson, 25,214 votes (53.7%) to 21,769 (46.3%).
In the November 8 general election, Arrington polled 176,314 votes (86.7%); Libertarian Troy Bonar trailed with 17,376 (8.5%), and the Green candidate, Mark Lawson, polled 9,785 (4.8%). No Democrat had filed to run in the heavily Republican district.


=== Political positions ===


==== National security ====
Arrington supported President Donald Trump's 2017 executive order curtailing Middle Eastern immigration, saying: "It is important that our commander in chief puts the safety of Americans first. Given concerns about the inadequate vetting of refugees and problems with our immigration system, this temporary pause is intended to ensure the safety of our citizens."


==== Unemployment benefits ====
In defending a proposal to cut access to the SNAP program (food stamps), Arrington cited the biblical passage Thessalonians 3:10, saying: "He says even when we were with you we give you this rule, 'If a man will not work he shall not eat.' And he goes on to say, 'We heard that some of you are idle.' I think that every American, Republican or Democrat wants to help the needy among us. And I think it's a reasonable expectation that we have work requirements. I think that gives more credibility, frankly, to SNAP."


==== Texas v. Pennsylvania ====
In December 2020, Arrington was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.


==== Immigration ====
Arrington voted against the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020, which authorizes DHS to nearly double the available H-2B visas for the remainder of FY 2020.
Arrington voted against the Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1158), which effectively prohibits Immigration and Customs Enforcement from cooperating with the Department of Health and Human Services to detain or remove illegal alien sponsors of Unaccompanied Alien Children.


==== Israel ====
Arrington voted to provide Israel with support following 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.


==== 2020 election certification ====
Arrington opposed certifying the electoral vote count in the 2020 presidential election, citing "millions of American voters" who felt that the election "was not conducted in an equitable or accurate manner." He later condemned the attack on the United States Capitol that occurred on January 6, 2021. In the weeks that followed, Arrington voted against the second impeachment of President Trump.


==== Big Tech ====
In 2022, Arrington was one of 39 Republicans to vote for the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act of 2022, an antitrust package that would crack down on corporations for anti-competitive behavior.


=== Committee assignment ===
United States House Committee on the Budget (Chairman)
Committee on Ways and Means


=== Caucus membership ===
Republican Study Committee


=== Awards and honors ===
Arrington received the 2003 Distinguished Public Service Award as part of the 22nd annual Center for Public Service Symposium in Lubbock.

Charles Eugene "Chip" Roy (born August 7, 1972) is an American attorney and politician serving as the U.S. representative for Texas's 21st congressional district. A member of the Republican Party, Roy took office on January 3, 2019. Before his election to Congress, he served as chief of staff to Senator Ted Cruz and as first assistant attorney general of Texas. A member of and policy chair of the House Freedom Caucus, Roy is considered a member of the far-right faction of the House Republican Conference.


== Early life and education ==
Roy was born in Bethesda, Maryland, and raised in Lovettsville, Virginia. His parents, Don and Rhonda Roy, were conservatives who supported Ronald Reagan and helped shape Roy's political views.
After graduating from Loudoun Valley High School, Roy attended the University of Virginia, receiving a Bachelor of Science in commerce in 1994 and a Master of Science in information systems in 1995. There, he worked as a dorm resident assistant for a year. After graduation Roy spent three years as an investment banking analyst. Wary that his career might require him to relocate to Manhattan, Roy decided to pursue a different career. He enrolled at the University of Texas School of Law, where he met his future wife, Carrah. He graduated in 2003 with a Juris Doctor.


== Early career ==


=== Cornyn staff ===
Though initially Roy saw politics "as an avocation, a sort of interest, but not something I would do anytime soon, if ever", his mind began to change when, while still in law school, he began working for then-Texas attorney general John Cornyn on his 2002 campaign for the United States Senate. After the September 11 attacks, Roy reflected on his goals. "I was in law school when September 11 happened. I will always remember that moment, crystallized in my head. That had a lot to do with my commitment to public service", he has said. When Cornyn was elected and made vice chairman of the Republican Committee and the Judiciary Committee, Roy served as his staff director and senior counsel. Roy provided counsel for Cornyn and his staff on legislative issues including nominations, intellectual property, crime, civil justice reform and advising him during the immigration reform debates under the George W. Bush administration. Roy worked for Cornyn until 2009.
Roy returned to Texas as a special assistant in the office of the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Texas. In 2006, Roy met Ted Cruz, then Texas Solicitor General, during a strategy session discussing the case League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry, a case about redistricting that Cruz argued before the United States Supreme Court.


=== Perry administration ===
Roy resigned from his job as a special assistant U.S. attorney after six months to be a ghostwriter on then-Governor of Texas Rick Perry's 2010 book Fed Up! and work for Perry's 2012 presidential campaign. The book served as a campaign agenda for Perry's campaign, and offered a range of Perry's positions, including criticism of the Social Security system as unconstitutional (calling it "a Ponzi scheme"), changing the election of U.S. senators back to state legislatures (they were made popularly elected by the Seventeenth Amendment), ending life tenure for federal judges, and repealing the 16th Amendment (which allows a federal income tax). The book also denounces as "overreach" federal efforts to regulate health care, labor conditions, energy policy, and pollution. In the book's acknowledgments section, Perry singled out Roy for "special recognition" for resigning his previous post "to devote himself full-time to the completion of the original manuscript" and his "amazing knowledge of the U.S. Constitution and other Founding documents, and a keen ability to frame federalist arguments in striking terms that make complicated law easier for non-lawyers like me to understand and discuss." In his review of the book, Gene Healy of the libertarian Cato Institute credited Roy as "the guy who did most of the heavy lifting in the book."
On April 1, 2011, Perry announced Roy as his choice for Texas's Director of State-Federal relations, an office whose duties include lobbying for federal funds for state institutions (such as grants to universities).
During the confirmation hearings for his position before the Texas Senate, Roy said he would oppose an "intrusive federal government that spends our money recklessly." He promised to help Texas legislators "push back on Washington where necessary" and stand up for "liberty, state sovereignty and an end to the crippling pile of debt and regulation coming from Washington that is destroying our nation and endangering the state." When asked about the recent Texas House vote to slash most of the office's funds, transferring them to a tuition reimbursement program for children of the military, he said it was "hardly surprising…I might have voted to cut it as well, based on what I understand of the office, but possibly without hiding behind the political gamesmanship of moving it from one account to another." He promised to consider eliminating the entire office if it didn't "stand for something." Roy's nomination was opposed by Texas State Senator Kirk Watson, who pointed out that the office's mission was "to promote communication and build relationships between the state and federal governments" and asked Roy "when you or someone else" decided to redefine its purpose. The committee approved Roy's nomination, 6–1, with the full State Senate later confirming the nomination. Roy served in the office from April to October 2011.
The week of his 39th birthday in August 2011, Roy was diagnosed with Stage 3 Hodgkin lymphoma. He later said his experience battling cancer convinced him of the importance of "health-care freedom", and that examining his medical bills showed him "how truly convoluted our system is."


=== Cruz staff ===

After Cruz's election to the Senate in 2012, Roy became his chief of staff. While working for Cruz, Roy gained attention for criticizing other Republicans who did not join Cruz in demanding Obamacare be defunded before voting to keep the government running past September 30, 2013. During the 2013 United States federal government shutdown, Roy's main tasks were behind the scenes, plotting a course through the media coverage and determining tactics when Republican allies deserted the cause and the party's leadership became increasingly hostile. Roy chastised defecting Republicans, and was quoted as saying Tom Coburn was serving in a "surrender caucus" and likening Mitch McConnell to Barack Obama. Cruz said Republicans who did not join him had fallen into "a powerful, defeatist approach…they're beaten down and they're convinced that we can't give a fight, and they're terrified." Their cause was joined by Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, Mark Meadows and Mike Lee.
The media picked up on Roy taking to Twitter to jab John McCain, sarcastically calling it "shocking" that "someone talking to [Democratic Senator Chuck] Schumer 5x a day and the White House daily" did not support the hardball approach. Coburn complained about these tactics to the Washington Examiner, saying: "The worst thing is being dishonest about what you can accomplish, ginning everybody up and then creating disappointment." Roy's response on Twitter gained media attention: "Since when is a promise to fight disastrous policy 'dishonest?' No, the worst thing is giving up & leaving your base believing there is no need to be a Republican any longer." Coburn told a reporter that he had "no ill will" toward Roy: "He knows I'm not part of the surrender caucus." He added: "a good portion of it [Obamacare] is mandatory spending, and the only way to get rid of mandatory spending…is 67 votes because you got to override a presidential veto" and that Cruz's and Roy's tactics would result in the Democrats taking control of the House.
Roy told a reporter that his job was to advance Cruz's priorities, and he had not been told to stand down: "The Washington establishment uses every tool at its disposal to push its own narrative on the American public—and in this case, it's the narrative of 'we can't.' They plant stories, strong-arm members and try to create fake 'wins' for cover that simply do not change the status quo. It is important that we push back." In response to questions about Roy's behavior, McCain said, "He and Senator Cruz are entitled to their opinions, but I don't pay that much attention to that kind of thing because I believe my position. It wouldn't be the first person who has criticized me." Richard Burr, who supported defunding but not threatening to cause a shutdown, also was unmoved by Roy's quips: "It doesn't matter to me what he does. The only thing that's important is that I'm on Senator Cruz's bill to eliminate Obamacare."
On September 25, 2013, Cruz and Roy met with trusted staffers and Cruz read aloud from Psalm 40 (which includes the line "troubles without number surround me") and then took to the Senate floor for a 21-hour speech against Obamacare. Despite such efforts the shutdown did not result in the desired policy change: the Republican leadership brokered a deal with the Democrats, reopened the government, and Obamacare funding was only marginally affected. Politico called Roy an "architect" of Cruz's strategy, and he later told a reporter, "Was I intimately involved with it? Yes. Unapologetically. I think it was the right strategy. And but for the same hand-wringers in the Senate that continue to give us the status quo, we might have been successful."
In September 2014, as Cruz contemplated a 2016 presidential campaign, Roy's duties in his office moved from chief of staff to top political strategist. During the exploratory phase of Cruz's campaign, Roy and Cruz got into an argument about political tactics and strategy that became heated enough to cause Roy to leave Cruz's Senate staff. Despite the level of disagreement, they discussed working together in the future. Cruz later recalled, "We often agreed, but not always, and we would have vigorous debates. Chip never backs down, and we would have extended discussions about which battles should be the highest priority."


=== Texas assistant attorney general ===
In 2014, despite controversy over the Texas State Securities Board issuing a disciplinary order against him for soliciting investment clients without being registered in the state, Ken Paxton easily won election as Texas attorney general. He chose Roy as his first assistant attorney general, saying: "Chip is a longtime friend, and someone whose counsel I trust. I am pleased that he will bring his strong legal mind, devotion to liberty, and servant's heart to the Office of Attorney General as first assistant." Roy's continuing battle with cancer influenced his decision to return to Texas, as he wished to be close to his family rather than commute weekly to Washington, D.C. or travel extensively on a presidential campaign.
Stepping into his role in Texas's attorney general's office, Roy confronted over 28,000 active cases, including high-profile cases on voter ID and same-sex marriage. He also participated in the 2015 lawsuit United States v. Texas against President Obama's executive action on immigration. The case challenged the constitutionality of the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA) program. Roy explained Texas's position to reporters: "the U.S. Senate and House aren't doing their job in standing up for and defending [the powers granted only to them by the Constitution's] Article 1, I think it is critical what Texas is doing in stepping up and defending when the president himself said repeatedly he didn't have the power to do this."
In July 2015, a Collin County grand jury indicted Paxton on two first-degree felony counts of securities fraud and a third-degree felony for failure to register as a securities dealer. Paxton maintained his innocence, but news stories continued to focus on the charges. Due to Paxton's decision to work from his home in McKinney rather than the capital in Austin, reporters covering the office's work highlighted the rolls of his solicitor general Scott Keller, his chief of staff Bernard McNamee, and especially Roy. With Paxton avoiding all but the friendliest audiences, speculation arose that Roy was the de facto attorney general.
In September 2015, while praising Roy at the Pflugerville First Baptist Church as one of the "visionaries on this religious liberties issue", Paxton said, "I get credit, sometimes not credit, for what happens in my office." MacNamee soon resigned in frustration over Paxton's behavior. Roy inadvertently drew unwanted attention to the situation in an interview about Texas's challenge to the DAPA program. When a reporter asked him how Paxton's legal problems affected the agency, Roy's response was seen as revealing Paxton's absence from running the office. He said, "We're in constant communication with the attorney general, and we're focused on doing our job every day to defend the state of Texas. ...The first assistant attorney general, the solicitor general, our head of civil litigation, all of us are charged to manage the daily affairs of this agency, and that's what we're doing."
When Paxton's name did not appear in a New York Times piece about a suit against Texas in the Supreme Court over abortion restrictions, his communications staff complained to Keller about it. Paxton traveled to Washington to hear the oral arguments, paying for his own ticket and submitting a copy of it to the state alongside the one his office had purchased for Roy to show how much money he had saved Texas. Eight days after the Supreme Court hearing, Paxton called his communications director, Allison Castle, who could not get any news organization to agree to interview him about the case. He demanded she resign or be fired. He then did the same to Roy, who resigned. Both were placed on emergency leave, which caused further controversy. Reporters also began to investigate whether Paxton had broken state law in the way he had hired staff: giving people the job before they filled out an application and without first advertising openings before filing them with people from outside the department. Paxton's choice to replace Roy was Jeff Mateer from First Liberty Institute, who had attracted notoriety by offering to represent, pro bono, any business that wished to sue the city of Plano over its anti-LGBT discrimination ordinance.


=== Cruz PAC ===
On March 10, 2016, the day after Paxton announced that Roy had "resigned to pursue other endeavors," he was named the executive director of the Trusted Leadership PAC, which was supporting Cruz's presidential campaign. The PAC was formed to bring the preexisting separate Cruz-supporting PACs into a single operating structure.
Controversy arose when it was discovered that Roy remained a state employee while working for the PAC. Roy responded that he had not received any pay from the PAC while he was on the state payroll, and only used his accrued vacation and compensatory time from the state after resigning to work for the PAC. This had left open the option for him to receive leave after his vacation and holiday time expired, which would have allowed him to continue receiving health benefits for his cancer treatment. After The Dallas Morning News reported on the matter, Roy fully resigned, maintaining that doing so was the result of a good report from his oncologist.
While working for the campaign, Roy called presidential candidate Donald Trump's conservative credentials into question, at one point tweeting, "@RealDonaldTrump Supports Planned Parenthood, which kills babies and puts them in a freezer, government funding of healthcare and Palestine."
At the time of Roy's hiring, pro-Cruz political consultant (and future Trump campaign manager) Kellyanne Conway had said, "This is a two-person race where Senator Cruz is building significant momentum and is the proven conservative, able to win the nomination and defeat Hillary Clinton," but Cruz dropped out of the race less than two months after Roy took over the PAC. Despite a scandal about the Cruz campaign's relationship with Cambridge Analytica, Roy and Trusted Leadership PAC had no interaction with the company.


=== Center for Tenth Amendment Action ===
By September 19, 2016, Roy had found employment as the Director of the Center for Tenth Amendment Action for the Texas Public Policy Foundation (TPPF), a conservative think tank.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 2018 ====

In 2018, Roy ran for the United States House of Representatives in Texas's 21st congressional district to succeed Lamar Smith, who did not run for reelection. Covering his campaign, Politico likened him to Cruz. Roy finished first in an 18-candidate field and received Smith's endorsement in a runoff on May 22 against Matt McCall. Roy said he agreed with Smith in questioning the scientific consensus on climate change which clearly attributes it to human activity.
When he supported Cruz in the 2016 presidential primary, Roy's criticism of Trump caused some of his friends to describe him as committed to the "Never Trump" cause. By 2018, his position had changed. Roy praised Trump's job performance as president, citing his decision to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate accords and his results in "regulatory relief, on tax relief, on judges, on the embassy in Jerusalem" and his attacks on "the swamp or the establishment or the status quo or whatever you want to call the inner workings of Washington, D.C." Roy also echoed Trump's position about a "deep state", which he defined as "entrenched bureaucrat[s] who hide something from the political decision-makers" causing "pushback from deep within the bowels of each of the agencies." He called for federal agencies "to be thinned out so that we don't have those issues."
Roy promised if elected to push back against the status quo and restrict the federal government's power, calling for Medicare to be delegated to the states, for Congress to pass a balanced budget, and for action to be taken to prevent judges from "legislating from the bench". He suggested that the House should attempt to pass no legislation the next term until it advanced a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. He also held that there were threats from "porous borders, gangs and drug cartels" that he would address if elected. The Club for Growth supported his candidacy. The House Freedom Fund (aligned with the Freedom Caucus in the House) contributed $143,000 to Roy's campaign. By February, Cruz joined in campaigning for Roy, telling voters, "I know how he responds under pressure, under heat, and that he won't buckle."
Roy finished 10 points ahead of McCall in the Republican primary election. He beat McCall by 5% in the "top-two" runoff. McCall credited much of Roy's victory to Cruz's endorsement and efforts. McCall said that Cruz was able to convince others to endorse Roy, even Louie Gohmert, whom McCall hailed as his congressional role model. Roy defeated Democratic nominee Joseph Kopser, a businessman, aerospace engineer and veteran, in the general election, 50%–48%, a closer than expected margin.


==== 2020 ====

As the 2020 electoral season approached, Democrats sought to associate Roy with Cruz, whose popularity was seen as in decline.
Roy was reelected, defeating Democratic nominee Wendy Davis by seven points and winning eight of the district's 10 counties.


==== 2022 ====

The Wall Street Journal described Roy's Republican primary race of 2022 as "a case study in whether a conservative Republican usually aligned with Mr. Trump can survive politically after angering the former president—even a modest amount." Even before a challenger arose against Roy, Trump had called for him to be defeated in the Republican primary. By June 2021, physician Robert Lowry had filed with the Federal Election Commission to face Roy in the primary, with the possibility of more candidates entering the race by the December 13 deadline. Roy ended up winning the primary with 83.2% of the vote, receiving more than 10 times as many votes as Lowry, who was the closest challenger. Roy went on to win the general election as well with 63% of the vote.


==== 2024 ====

In 2024, Roy was re-elected with 61.9% of the vote in the general election against Democratic candidate Kristin Hook.


=== Tenure ===

Coming into office, Roy cast himself as a conservative version of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: "I doubt she and I agree on many issues. But functionally, this place is broken." He was happy to be part of the Freedom Caucus: "they're serving as a check against the current broken system where the power brokers make decisions at the top and just say 'Here's what we're going to do'." He added that Republican power brokers in Congress lost control of the House because "You demonstrate rote incompetence when you are leaving us with a trillion dollars in deficits this year on top of $22 trillion in debt. You said you were going to do something to secure our border, and you didn't. And you said you were going to fight for—I use the term 'health care freedom'—and you didn't. It's hard to really take that to the people and say, 'Hey, send me back'."
Roy's first speech as a representative was on immigration and what he called "chaos and lawlessness on the southern border." He complained that "members of both sides of the aisle have buried their heads in the sand over the last several decades, talking instead of doing." Right-leaning news outlets hailed Roy's speech.
Soon after taking office, Roy opposed a bill in the House that tried to prevent Trump from withdrawing from NATO without Congress's consent. It passed, 357 to 22. When the House voted to give back pay to the 800,000 federal workers affected by the government shutdown, Roy opposed the measure. Roy was one of few Republicans to vote against the measure, which passed 411 to 7. Trump signed the bill into law.
In July 2021, Roy voted against the bipartisan ALLIES Act, which would increase by 8,000 the number of special immigrant visas for Afghan allies of the U.S. military during its invasion of Afghanistan, while also reducing some application requirements that caused long application backlogs; the bill passed in the House 407–16.
In 2021, a recording of Roy surfaced in which he said he wanted "18 more months of chaos and the inability to get stuff done" during a Democratic-controlled Congress and presidency. Roy's conservative positions have frequently put him in conflict with House GOP leadership.


==== Relief bill opposition ====
On May 24, 2019, Roy singlehandedly halted a House disaster relief funding bill that gave $19 billion in relief for communities hit by disasters, including $900 million for hurricane-damaged Puerto Rico, and fast-tracked $4 billion in grants to Texans suffering due to the effects of Hurricane Harvey. The money for Texas had been approved in 2018 but held up due to working out regulations with the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Office of Management and Budget. Cornyn had championed the bill and Cruz voted for it. House leaders of both parties had agreed to advance the bill under a quick procedure rule that required unanimous consent of those in the chamber. Most members of Congress had already left Washington for the Memorial Day recess. The day before, the Senate had passed the bill 85–8, and the House had passed a similar version earlier in the month 257–150. Due to Roy's objection, the unanimous consent vote was derailed.
Roy blamed Nancy Pelosi for the previous delay in Texans receiving the funds and voiced his dislike of procedure being used.
During other pro forma sessions, Roy's tactic was adopted by Representatives Thomas Massie and John Rose, who returned to Washington during the recess week for two more similar unanimous consent request attempts. Ultimately Roy's action delayed the bill's passage for several days until lawmakers returned from recess.
Hurricane season began on June 1 and coastal communities soon began seeing flooding amid strong storms. The bill was stalled for 11 days before passing on June 3 by a margin of 354–58, with Roy voting against it. Roy received bipartisan criticism for his objection to the bill. He explained his vote against the measure, saying it added to the national debt and did not include additional spending for federal operations along the U.S.–Mexico border. Five other Texas representatives joined Roy in opposing the bill: Lance Gooden, John Ratcliffe, Van Taylor, Ron Wright, and Michael Cloud (whose district bore the direct brunt of Hurricane Harvey).


==== Procedural protest, 2019 ====
On June 12, 2019, Roy derailed the usually uneventful House procedural process for appropriation bills. During the first debate of a four-bill spending package of the upcoming 2020 fiscal year the chamber scheduled for working through amendments through most of the day, with roll call votes not expected until around 5:30 p.m., Roy rose in an effort to protest what he saw as Democratic inaction on Trump's $4.5 billion supplemental funding request for the Department of Homeland Security (to address what his administration held was urgently needed due to an increasing number of migrants at the southern border). From the floor he halted the normal process by making a motion to adjourn at 12:14 p.m. The motion was defeated, 146–244. Representative Andy Biggs then made another motion to adjourn, which was defeated, 140–254. Members of both parties voted against the motions and voiced complaints about the disruption. Members had been forced to leave committee hearings, markups, lunches, and other events for the unscheduled votes.
After the votes the House resumed normal business, beginning a debate on a rule governing proceedings on the fiscal package. While managing the debate on the rule for the Republican minority, Woodall yielded his time to several members of his conference. Each requested unanimous consent for immediate consideration of the border funding supplemental. The chair declined these, ruling the time may be yielded only for debate on the rule in question. When proceedings shifted to amendment debate and lawmakers proceeded to call for a voice vote on many of the amendments (most of them uncontroversial), Roy objected and asked for roll call votes on each one. This once again caused members to have to return to the chamber for unscheduled votes, and as Roy continued to use this tactic it became clear that the previous schedule, which anticipated finishing up no later than 11 p.m., would be extended until early in the morning.
Roy continued to call for roll-call votes for each of the dozens of amendments offered. This caused members of both parties to voice displeasure with him and cancel their evening plans. Roy himself canceled his plans for his 15-year wedding anniversary. The House finished voting at 4 a.m.
The Texas Tribune reported that by such tactics Roy within "a span of just three weeks…established a reputation as the leading obstructionist in the House."


==== Amending the ADA ====
On June 28, 2019, in response to the humanitarian crisis involving migrant children at the southern border, Roy proposed legislation to amend the Antideficiency Act (ADA) to allow the United States Border Patrol to accept donations from people who want to help migrant children directly. The bill was filed after Border Patrol officials turned away people attempting to donate supplies such as diapers, toys, and hygiene items, saying they could not accept donations due to the ADA, which prevents the government from accepting "any donations other than what Congress has allocated to it."


==== Response to Paxton allegations ====
On October 5, 2020, while campaigning for reelection, Roy called for Paxton's resignation after seven senior leaders within his office (including Roy's replacement, Jeff Mateer) accused him of bribery, abuse of office, and other charges. Roy noted that rather than address the charges and demonstrate their falsity, Paxton had attacked the staffers' character. He took particular issue with Paxton's choice "to attack the very people entrusted, by him, to lead the office—some of whom I know well and whose character are beyond reproach."
Hours after Roy's call for him to step down, Paxton released a statement saying, "Despite the effort by rogue employees and their false allegations I will continue to seek justice in Texas and will not be resigning." The charges arose from Paxton's relationship with Nate Paul, an Austin real estate developer who donated $25,000 to Paxton's 2018 campaign. Paxton claimed that his office had been referred a case investigating an FBI raid in August 2019 of Paul's offices and home which had "allegations of crimes relating to the FBI, other government agencies and individuals". When it was brought to Roy's attention that Paul had donated $2,700 to him the same 2018 electoral cycle, Roy said he did "not recall meeting Mr. Paul and it shows as an online contribution."


==== Response to 2020 presidential election ====
Over 100 text messages gathered by the January 6th Commission revealed the coordination by Roy and Utah's U.S. Senator Mike Lee with Trump Chief of Staff Mark Meadows to overturn Trump's defeat in the 2020 election.
On November 7, 2020, before traveling to Georgia to help fight the election results there, Roy texted Meadows: "Dude, we need ammo. We need fraud examples. We need it this weekend": two days earlier, he had texted Meadows: "We have no tools / data / information to go out and fight RE: election / fraud. If you need / want it, we all need to know what's going on." On the same day, he also appealed to Meadows to have "The President tone down the rhetoric, and approach the legal challenge firmly, intelligently and effectively without resorting to throwing wild desperate haymakers, or whipping his base into a conspiracy frenzy." On November 19, 2020, he texted Meadows to express his concern for the lack of evidence, writing: "Hey brother - we need substance or people are going to break."
On December 10, 2020, Roy wrote in opposition to Paxton's lawsuit Texas v. Pennsylvania, demanding four other states' election results be overturned as part of Trump's false claims that Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election was the result of widespread voter fraud. Despite 106 of his fellow House Republicans filing an amicus brief in support of the lawsuit, Roy wrote, "I will not join because I believe the case itself represents a dangerous violation of federalism & sets a precedent to have one state asking federal courts to police the voting procedures of other states. I cannot support an effort that will almost certainly fail on grounds of standing and is inconsistent with my beliefs about protecting Texas sovereignty from the meddling of other states. Our remedy must be, from this day forward, to decline to allow the usurpation of our authority as people—through our states—to govern ourselves in all respects." Cornyn also questioned Paxton's lawsuit, telling reporters "I, frankly, struggle to understand the legal theory of it." After the Supreme Court declined to hear the case, Roy told a reporter, "It was clearly evident and obvious that it would have zero chance of success for anybody who understands the law and understands the Supreme Court and understands how these cases are going to go."
On December 31, 2020, in reference to attempts to challenge the results of the 2020 election, Roy texted Meadows: "The President should call everyone off. It's the only path. If we substitute the will of states through electors with a vote by Congress every 4 years, we have destroyed the electoral college"; the next day he texted Meadows that if Trump "allows this to occur, we're driving a stake in the heart of the federal republic." Roy joined fellow Republican Legislators Thomas Massie, Kelly Armstrong, Ken Buck, Mike Gallagher, Nancy Mace, and Tom McClintock in issuing a statement on January 3, 2021, against their colleagues' efforts to challenge the results of the 2020 election. They signed a letter that, while giving credence to the idea that "significant abuses in our election system resulting from the reckless adoption of mail-in ballots and the lack of safeguards maintained to guarantee that only legitimate votes are cast and counted," held that "only the states have authority to appoint electors, in accordance with state law. Congress has only a narrow role in the presidential election process. Its job is to count the electors submitted by the states, not to determine which electors the states should have sent." They pointed to the Twelfth Amendment in support of their position, and wrote, "As of this moment, not a single state has submitted multiple conflicting slates of electoral votes. …Unless that happens between now and January 6, 2021, Congress will have no authority to influence the outcome of the 2020 presidential election." Congressional action despite this "would amount to stealing power from the people and the states. It would, in effect, replace the electoral college with Congress, and in so doing strengthen the efforts of those on the left who are determined to eliminate it or render it irrelevant." The letter called on Republican legislators to remember their oath: "We must respect the states' authority here. Though doing so may frustrate our immediate political objectives, we have sworn an oath to promote the Constitution above our policy goals. We must count the electoral votes submitted by the states."
On the same day as the joint statement, Roy objected to the seating of 67 incoming representatives from states that Trump claimed rigged their elections against him: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Roy held that if his Republican colleagues (including Gohmert and Cruz) were going to hold that ballots should be questioned about the presidential race (calling for an emergency 10-day audit), then no certainty could be granted for any race. He said "a number of my colleagues...have publicly stated that they plan to object to the acceptance of electors from those particular six states due to their deeply held belief that those states conducted elections plagued by statewide, systemic fraud and abuse that leaves them absolutely no way for this chamber or our constituents to trust the validity of their elections. Such allegations, if true, raise significant doubts about the elections of at least some of the members of the United States House of Representatives that, if not formally addressed, could cast a dark cloud of suspicion over the validity of this body for the duration of the 117th Congress." He added, "It would confound basic human reason if the presidential results were to face objection while the congressional results of the same process escaped without public scrutiny." Roy apologized to those who had come to the swearing-in ceremony and said that if a colleague objected to his own seating in response he would welcome a vote.
Due to Roy's actions, the House held a vote on the matter and the result was 371 to 2 in favor of moving ahead with the swearing in of all members. The Dallas Morning News wrote that Roy's actions were "a dramatic escalation in the GOP feud" over the counting of electoral votes, noting Roy was in the minority of his party but "a conservative firebrand...[who] has developed a reputation for a damn-the-consequences approach to doing what he thinks is right, even if it means irking his fellow Republicans."
Roy spent most of January 5, 2021, working on the remarks he planned on giving on the House floor the next day. He called constitutional scholars as well as other members to sharpen his writing. At the end of the day, when returning to his Virginia apartment, he stopped at a sports bar and was troubled by what he saw: "The place was filled with MAGA Trump supporters. Absolutely filled. I kept hearing people say, 'Liberals are going to be upset tomorrow when the vice president stops this steal and gives this election back to the president.' I heard that repeatedly from people in that bar. I had called the Sheriff of Hays County earlier that day to tell him to look after Carrah and the kids and I told friends here in town to look after Carrah and the kids because I could tell things were getting a little amped up. And that night I re-texted the sheriff and said 'Please be keeping an eye out for Carrah and the kids' because the temperature was so high."
The next day, when there was an objection to counting Arizona's electoral votes, Roy went with the other members of the House to debate their acceptance. He began seeing notifications on social media of an angry mob outside the Capitol and began texting his staff to try to ensure their safety in the Longworth office building. Legislators paused the debate when the Capitol police announced a breach in the building, but thinking it isolated, resumed debate. Roy was in the well of the lectern about fourth in line to the microphone, where he planned to object to those objecting to the electoral votes. After Capitol police instructed members to hunker in place and make use of their emergency gas masks, Roy tweeted, "To those storming the Capitol - I am on the House floor and I will not be deterred from upholding my oath, under God, to the Constitution by mob demand." Roy felt to stay in the chamber would be like a "sitting duck" and was able to get Capitol police to direct representatives to a secure exit. Upon receiving their instructions, Roy went to the indicated door and called for his fellow members to exit through it while he held it open.
During the January 6 Capitol attack, Roy was in the House chamber. He tweeted to Trump, "Mr. President - get to a microphone immediately and establish calm and order. Now. And work with Capitol Police to secure the Capitol. It's the last thing you'll do that matters as President." He later told a reporter, "We must enforce the law. People have breached the Capitol, they need to go to jail. It's dangerous. A lot of people there with a lot of emotions running high. Look, I wish the president had spun people to—as I said, on the floor of the House of Representatives [Wednesday] night—to believe things that were not going to happen, and that was unfortunate." As Congress prepared to return to the chambers, Roy tweeted, "We will reconvene. We will vote to accept the electors from the states, as instructed by the Constitution. That is our job."
Returning to the chamber once safety was restored, Roy addressed the House, "Many of my colleagues were poised this afternoon to vote to insert Congress into the constitutionally prescribed decision-making of the states by rejecting the sole official electors sent to us by each of the states of the union. I hope they will reconsider. I can tell you that I was not going to, and I will not be voting to reject the electors. And that vote may well sign my political death warrant. But so be it. I swore an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States—and I will not bend its words into contortions for political expediency and then claim I am honoring that oath." In the two House votes that challenged the electors of Arizona and Pennsylvania, Roy voted to certify the electors appointed by those states.
Even as Roy's favorability dropped significantly in his district, he said he had no regrets: "I did not take an oath to the political expediency of either Donald Trump or any other member of a political party. I took an oath to the Constitution of the United States. My view is immovable in that regard. And for those raising questions about it, I want to know where they were—precisely where they were—when a Capitol Hill police officer was getting his head bashed in by a fire extinguisher by an angry mob spun up in no small part by the president's irresponsible actions." Roy told a reporter that Republicans were "being fed misinformation" and that one of his responsibilities was to counsel voters on just how they were misled.


==== Second impeachment of Donald Trump ====
During the second impeachment of Donald Trump, Roy held that Trump's behavior "was clearly, in my opinion, impeachable conduct, pressuring the vice president to violate his oath to the Constitution." Still, Roy opposed impeachment. He held that the Democratic leadership in the House "drafted articles that I believe are flawed… focusing on the legally specific terms of incitement and insurrection. Even noting impeachment does not require meeting a certain legal standard – the danger for open speech & debate in this body and for the Republic generally is high – if the House approves the articles as written." If accepted, he said, "The language of this impeachment will be used to target members of this body under section 3 of the 14th Amendment. It will be used to suggest that any statements we make are subject to review by our colleagues and send us down the perilous path of the cleansing political speech in the public square."
Roy joined all of Texas's House Republicans in voting against impeachment. When asked whether he or any of his fellow Republicans had been threatened with violence if they voted to impeach, Roy said, "I'm not aware of any specific threats against me or anybody else. Honestly, if somebody would have threatened me, I probably would have said FU and voted to impeach. I just don't react well to that sort of thing."


==== Defense of Ted Cruz ====
In events leading up to the insurrection at the Capitol, reporters observed an ideological split between Roy and Cruz. On January 5, Roy forced members of the House to go on record in a voice vote concerning the seating of 67 representatives-elect from the six states that Trump asserted had invalid elections, a move The Washington Post called a "gutsy step" that was "putting a spotlight on the hypocrisy of his fellow Republicans" for contesting the presidential results in those states but not the results for other races in those states, though the same methods were used to tabulate votes.
That same day the media learned that Cruz would join Representatives Andy Biggs and Paul Gosar in objecting to the certification of Arizona's electoral votes, despite Attorney General William Barr's declaration that there was no evidence of fraud and despite every lawsuit put forward to challenge the outcome in Arizona having been dismissed or dropped by Trump's legal team. Cruz led a coalition of 11 Republican senators demanding an audit. Cruz's objections to Arizona were joined by Senator Josh Hawley challenging Pennsylvania's electoral votes and Senator Kelly Loeffler those of Georgia. In contrast, Roy called on his fellow legislators to recall that "we have sworn an oath to promote the Constitution above our policy goals" and that they had a duty to follow its text.
The Post contrasted Roy with Cruz, who it said "is stoking his 2024 presidential hopes by helping to lead a dishonest drive to question the electoral college results." James Tilove of Texas Monthly wrote of Cruz and Roy, "Their paths on January 6 could not have been more divergent, with Roy denouncing the president and the elector challenges, and Cruz continuing that night to press his objection to certifying the Biden electors from Arizona—the first of two states voted on—even after witnessing the terrible passions the doomed maneuver had stirred." Roy acknowledged that he and Cruz disagreed on how to honor their oaths to the Constitution, but said, "My friendship with Senator Ted Cruz is immovable. I think everybody needs to dial it down on both kinds of extremes. Those attacking [Cruz and some others] and calling them seditionists, it's absolutely absurd. We can agree to disagree on these things and we need to. I'll have more to say on that later but my friendship with Senator Ted Cruz is not up for negotiation."
On January 28, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez expressed a desire in a tweet to "know more" about the stock trading app Robinhood, which had blocked some retail investors' trading while hedge funds faced no such constraints. When Cruz tweeted his agreement, Ocasio-Cortez rebuffed him, holding that his calling the Electoral College votes into question had helped incite the January 6 insurrectionists, some of whom called for violence against her. She tweeted: "I am happy to work with Republicans on this issue where there's common ground, but you almost had me murdered 3 weeks ago so you can sit this one out. Happy to work w/ almost any other GOP that aren't trying to get me killed. In the meantime if you want to help, you can resign."
Roy objected to Ocasio-Cortez's assertions in a letter to Pelosi demanding that she be forced to apologize or face sanctions, saying "she accused Senator Ted Cruz, in essence, of attempted murder. it is completely unacceptable behavior for a Member of Congress to make this kind of scurrilous charge against another member in the House or Senate for simply engaging in speech and debate regarding electors as they interpreted the Constitution. …It is my sincere hope that we all stop this heightened rhetoric and move forward to actually do the work the American people sent us here to do."
On February 1, Ocasio-Cortez detailed her experience on January 6, which was compounded by the trauma of being a sexual assault survivor, saying, "Ted Cruz and Representatives Chip Roy, and, oh, by the way, some of the other representatives who actually encouraged people to threaten members of Congress, or tweeted out the location of the Speaker, are now telling me to apologize for saying and speak truth to what happened. These are the tactics that abusers use. The folks who are saying, 'We should move on,' 'We shouldn't have accountability,' etc., are saying, 'Can you just forget about this so we can do it again?'" Roy replied that he was saddened to learn she had been a victim of sexual assault, but "I will not be swayed from my beliefs about right and wrong—regarding this or anything else." He took issue with being accused of using abuser tactics: "Her comparison of my defense of colleagues to her circumstances were again inappropriate…It does not change the fact that her allegation against Sen. Cruz was completely unacceptable for a Member of Congress to make against another member for engaging in free speech and debate about what our Constitution says about electors. Nor does it change my position that she should apologize for and retract those remarks."


==== Procedural protest, 2021 ====
On March 8, 2021, 13 suspension bills—bills brought up under suspension of House rules—were scheduled to be put forward on the House floor, including a measure with overwhelming Republican support to present the U.S. Capitol Police with a Congressional Gold Medal. These plans were scrapped because Roy and Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene expressed their intent to demand recorded roll call votes for each bill. As this parliamentary maneuver would have forced voting to go into the early morning, the leadership rescheduled the voting.
Of the delay, Roy said, "We need to continue to have conversations about every bill that's moving through the floor." He held that instead of the suspension calendar being "done right", the Democratic leadership was "jamming through 10 Democrat bills [and] three Republican bills on a Monday we fly back, while we're jamming through a $2 trillion bill which we have no say in, while we've got fences around the Capitol, we've metal detectors, etc. …We need to have a conversation in this town about how to make the House work again. That's what we're doing." He said his motivation was to force conversations over how to make Congress "work better" as "This place is completely dysfunctional."
Roy also criticized the Democratic leadership for doing away with the "motion to recommit", which Republicans in the previous Congress had used to force last-minute changes to legislation on the House floor. House Minority Whip Steve Scalise made clear the House Republican leadership had not planned or approved Roy's remarks, but also said he too wanted "to see an open process."
Not all of the GOP Leadership opposed Roy; Conference Chair Liz Cheney said, "This process is not going to be able to continue smoothly as long as the Democrats continue to try to ram pieces of legislation through without adequate hearings, without adequate debate and discussion, without adequate ability to offer amendments, without a motion to recommit. …The majority needs to understand we are not interested in a situation where they have taken away so many rights of the minority and they expect things are going to operate smoothly. It shouldn't be a surprise to anyone that this is going on." Democrats characterized the moves as producing nothing but pointless delay and agitation. They singled out Greene as merely attention-seeking due to having been stripped of her committee assignments in February, and her repeated disruptions of the legislative process (such as discussion of the Equality Act) by use of "motions to adjourn debate", forcing members to hurry to the House floor to vote to remain in session.
The Republican caucus, increasingly annoyed by Greene's tactics, were more supportive of Roy's, as the timing allowed both the protest to gain attention, along with a rescheduling that prevented mass disruption. Hoyer and Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy held talks on how to address Roy's and Greene's maneuvers. In its coverage of the episode, Politico called Roy "a master of procedural delays on the floor." Due to changes in the rules on account of the COVID-19 pandemic, each roll-call vote took at least an additional 45 minutes longer than under normal circumstances, and a growing number of Republicans joined with Democrats in complaining about the delays.


===== Bills honoring Capitol Police =====
Among the bills that were rescheduled due to Roy's procedural protest was one giving Congressional Gold Medals to the Capitol Police and the assisting police forces who withstood the January 6 attack on the Capitol. When the measure received a roll call vote on March 17, it did not pass with unanimous support. Twelve Republicans voted against it, objecting to the use of the word "insurrectionists". Roy, who had earlier said, "These words all matter, right? …I have to study the language fully", supported the measure. The final vote tally was 413–12.
The bill moved to the Senate, which had passed its own version. A new bill was created to resolve the differences between the two versions. The largest change was the addition of having a medal displayed inside the Capitol itself, and lines that added those Capitol Police officers who suffered under the car ramming attack on a Senate security barricade on April 2, 2021. The revised bill returned to the House and was put up for a vote on June 15. Despite his vote in March, Roy joined 20 other Republicans in voting against this version, which passed, 406–21. Roy released a statement saying the original "legislation has since been amended to include events that have absolutely nothing to do with January 6th. Instead of honoring our men and women of law enforcement, Democrats are playing political games with the tragedy of April 2, 2021."


==== Leadership bid ====

Roy defended Representative Liz Cheney when the House voted to strip her of her position as chair of the House Republican Conference over her criticism of Trump. On January 13, 2021, he said: "It has come to my attention that a number of my colleagues are circulating calls for Liz Cheney to step down from, or to be removed as, chair of the Republican Conference for her position in support of impeachment of the president. I reject this call, and offer my support. …there can be little debate that, among other things, the president's pressure exerted on Vice President Pence to violate his oath, and the false hope it sent to emotionally charged supporters, was wrong, troubling, and impeachable. Liz should be commended, not condemned, for standing up in defense of the Constitution and standing true to her beliefs."
On May 11, Roy released a memo calling the conference to be clear that the controversy over Cheney was not about her position that the election "was not stolen", but rather that she had "forfeited her ability to be our spokesperson by pulling us into distraction. …looking backwards while repeatedly and unhelpfully engaging in personal attacks and finger-wagging towards President Trump rather than leading the conference forward with a unifying message." He said the conference should be "fighting to stop the radical Democrat agenda" rather than "falling prey to the high drama of swamp politics." After Representative Elise Stefanik announced that she would run to succeed Cheney, Roy and other conservative Republicans had discussed concerns over Stefanik's comparably moderate voting record, with Roy taking the lead in this group. His May 11 memo accused Stefanik of campaigning as a Republican but supporting the Democrats' agenda once sworn in.
Representative Lance Gooden told a reporter that with the amount of support Stefanik had gathered, her victory seemed virtually assured, so "One of the problems of those who had issues with Elise were that no one had really stepped forward to run against her, they were being critical, but no one really seemed to have the nerve to put their name down. So it seems as if Chip Roy is that candidate." Roy's fundraising campaign sent out donation requests that emphasized his opposition to Cheney.
Cheney was ultimately ousted from her position as chair by voice vote with no one objecting.
By May 13, shortly before a scheduled candidate forum, Roy officially announced his candidacy for the position. He cited what he saw as Stefanik's lack of conservative qualifications and the rapid pace of the process as his reasons for running. (After Cheney was ousted that Wednesday, McCarthy had scheduled the forum for Thursday evening and the vote for Friday morning.) After Trump released a statement opposing Roy, the conservative group FreedomWorks came out in support of Roy, saying they were pleased to hear of his nomination, and that "Rep. Roy has a lifetime 100% voting record on our scorecard. He has demonstrated that Republicans can legislate based on conservative principles and also get elected in competitive districts."
Around 60 House Republicans gathered for the candidate forum to hear pitches between Roy and Stefanik to take over the position. The forum was described as a friendly and formal back-and-forth, with Roy contending that he was the more conservative choice, and Stefanik emphasizing her work to elect GOP women along with her ability to fundraise. Both promised to set aside their personal views to better deliver party messaging. Some attendees told reporters that they felt many in the audience had previously decided who they would support before the forum was even held. Roy did not respond to any questions after the forum: "We are going to have a vote tomorrow in the Republican conference." When asked whether Trump's endorsement of Stefanik and bashing of him concerned him, Roy likened the reporters to "vultures" and said: "This is all D.C. swamp business."
In contrast, Stefanik called the forum a "great discussion", said she had cross-conference support and "we are in a strong position." On May 14, the day of the election, Representative Ken Buck of the Freedom Caucus formally nominated Roy, and his nomination was seconded by Boebert. Roy lost the election to Stefanik in a secret ballot, 134–46. Afterward he released a statement congratulating Stefanik, but taking pride in being able to "provide an alternative with a proven record of standing up not for politicians—but for freedom, the Constitution, and the conservative principles Americans hold dear."


==== Legal concerns around January 6 rioters ====
Roy did not support the House measure to create the January 6 commission. He held that forming a commission was not "a responsible and proper way" to investigate the issue, and that "The proposed commission does not have powers that existing law enforcement and existing congressional committees don't already have; however, it does have an unlimited budget and a vague mandate." The bill passed the House on May 19, 2021, by a vote of 252 to 175.
On May 13, Roy and Representative Thomas Massie sent Attorney General Merrick Garland a letter expressing concern that those facing federal charges for participation in the January 6 rioters would be subject to "overly aggressive tactics, overcharge, and abuse of power of the federal government in order to satisfy favored political groups." They claimed that they had heard reports that Assistant U.S. Attorneys were not allowed discretion to "enter into plea deals without permission from political appointees" at the Department of Justice. They also wrote, "there are disturbing reports of heavily armed teams of federal agents bursting into family homes to arrest individuals with no history or likelihood of violence", and demanded congressional oversight of the prosecutions. When Massie's office was asked their sources for the reports, they responded, "Mr. Roy's office has spoken with attorneys handling these cases and we can't comment any further than that."
Emmett Till Antilynching Act
Roy, Andrew Clyde and Thomas Massie were the only House members to vote against The Emmett Till Antilynching Act, which passed the 117th United States Congress.


==== 2023 Speaker of the United States House of Representatives elections ====
On January 3, 2023, at the beginning of the 118th Congress, during the election of the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, Roy nominated and voted for Byron Donalds for Speaker, in rebuke of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Roy became a leader in the negotiation process for the holdouts against McCarthy. Roy and his group of about 20 wanted: (1) to bring down the threshold for calling a vote of no confidence against the speaker to one member, (2) more enforcement to allow more time to read bills, (3) a greater role for the House Freedom Caucus in Republican leadership, requiring Republican leadership to refrain from being involved in primary elections, and (4) an end to U.S. aid to Ukraine. Roy switched his vote to McCarthy on the 12th, 13th, 14th, and 15th ballots.
During the October 2023 Speaker election, as the House Republican Conference considered choosing Majority Leader Steve Scalise or Judiciary Committee chair Jim Jordan as their nominee for Speaker, Roy (who supported Jordan) made a proposal that would have required 217 of the 221 members to support the eventual nominee before a floor vote could be held; the idea was tabled 135-88. Jordan was ultimately nominated, and Roy voted for him on the first three floor ballots. On the fourth ballot, Roy, along with all other present Republicans, voted for the new nominee Mike Johnson, who was elected Speaker.


==== Debt ceiling ====
In December 2024, Roy opposed raising the United States debt ceiling. As a result, Donald Trump criticised him and encouraged Texas Republicans to consider a primary challenge.


=== Committee assignments ===


==== Current ====
Committee on Judiciary
Committee on Veterans' Affairs


==== Previous ====
Committee on Oversight and Reform
Committee on the Budget


=== Caucus memberships ===
Freedom Caucus
Republican Study Committee


== Political positions ==
During the 117th Congress, Roy voted with President Joe Biden's stated position 1.8% of the time according to a FiveThirtyEight analysis.


=== COVID-19 pandemic ===
On March 13, 2020, Trump declared the COVID-19 pandemic a national emergency, allowing access to billions in aid. The same day, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Speaker Nancy Pelosi concluded negotiations for a COVID-19 relief bill. The $2.2 billion measure included funding for free testing for the uninsured, paid sick leave, $1 billion for food aid, and extended unemployment along with other measures to address Americans affected by the pandemic. The next morning, Roy was among the Republican representatives who voted against the bill, calling it "welfare". The bill passed 363–40.
As the pandemic began to spread, Maine Governor Janet Mills released an executive order on April 3 calling on out-of-state visitors to self-quarantine for 14 days after entering Maine. This was seen as a response to Mainers, especially in coastal communities, who were complaining that non-residents were trying to escape more crowded urban areas and endangering the community. Mills made a point not to authorize investigating people solely due to out-of-state license plates, so that military or health care workers who had come to the state would not feel harassed. Maine's law enforcement held that the order would be difficult to enforce due to limited staffing and that it was mainly an effort to have neighbors encourage each other to comply with the rules. Cumberland County Sheriff Kevin Joyce told reporters, "If we receive a complaint we will send a deputy to educate the person about the quarantine but trying to build a case or enforce the order is unrealistic."
On April 6, Roy guested on The Mark Levin Show and criticized governors like Mills who had responded forcefully to the pandemic, saying that they were following projections about infections that were mere guesses "not even [based on statistical] models, they are fingers in the air. And they are throwing them out there and they are causing the American people to freak out and panic instead of going through this logically." Roy agreed with Mark Levin that governors in "states who barely have this virus" who were issuing stay-at-home orders were overreacting, saying, "Well, I am glad that there's a number of governors who haven't. …And there was a Maine sheriff today who basically told the Maine governor to pound sand. He is not going to go around and check people when they are driving around the state of Maine. And we need more of that. We need more rational human beings who are going to step back and say 'No, this isn't a police state. This isn't Nazi Germany. This isn't Russia. We are not going to do that. What we're going to do is have common sense discussions on what we can do to make things better.'"
Roy also said that state authorities defining which businesses were essential was a form of tyranny: "I always get entertained or really frankly ticked off at these local county judges and mayors and these little tinpot dictators that are making decisions about peoples' lives when they declare what is and is not an essential business. ..You know what? Any business is essential to its owner and the people who work there. Every single one of them... and all the central planners effectively are deciding how we live our lives."
In May 2020, Roy said, "We need immune systems that are strong. We need immunity systems that can fight this... We need herd immunity." Asked whether acquiring such immunity would entail unnecessary deaths, Roy said that the countrywide stay-at-home orders and attendant delays in accessing cancer screenings or entering into addiction treatment, as well as mental health problems precipitated by unemployment, had increased indirect deaths and suffering.
In July 2020, Roy blamed surging coronavirus cases in Southern Texas on "people coming across our border" from Mexico. At the time, the border with Mexico had been closed for all nonessential activity since March.
In a July 28 appearance with talk show host Steve Deace, Roy suggested that the stay-at-home orders imposed in response to the pandemic were a part of "a fraud being perpetrated on the American people of fear. We are literally, purposely allowing the government...we are purposely causing fear among the American people by virtue of the actions or inactions of our government leaders and then allowing the media to spin up that fear. That is unfortunate and it is costing lives and it's costing economic activity, it's costing jobs and it's costing mental health, and it's frankly undermining our national security and the health of our nation, and frankly I don't think that's accidental. I think that is all about design and all about reclaiming power in November and I think on November fourth there'll be a magic awakening of how we can suddenly beat the virus. …[We need to] start raising a fuss, say 'this is my country. I want my country back, and I want to live healthily and I don't want a bureaucrat government or insurance or otherwise standing between me and my doctor; me and my ability to stay healthy; me and my ability to live free.' And that's what's happening and we need to stop it."
Roy said that Texas was holding COVID-19 cases down; in fact, cases were surging in Texas at the time. Later that month, after Representative Louie Gohmert tested positive for COVID-19, Roy said he did not plan to isolate himself even though he had had a recent maskless interaction with Gohmert on the House floor.
Roy retweeted a comment by Deace on November 13 that said, "We are not going to honor any of these CDC Thanksgiving guidelines, and instead will intentionally violate them all. But thanks." Roy's tweet added, "I will do whatever I want to do on Thanksgiving. Period. #StandUpForAmerica". Two days later, Roy retweeted his earlier tweet and added, "I apologize to the folks who have raised concerns that I said 'I will do whatever I want to do on Thanksgiving. Period.' I should have been more clear, so here it goes: 'I will do whatever I want to do on Thanksgiving … or any other day … Period.'"
On December 23, 2020, Roy joined Trump's opposition to a recently passed $900 billion COVID-19 relief package, saying, "This bill is an irresponsible swamp bill. It is the merger of an omnibus bill that is bloated with typical wasteful spending, on top of a relief bill that has a whole lot of things in it that frankly aren't all that focused on relief. The president's right to call B.S. on this ridiculous bill. Both parties are at fault. …The American people don't just want another check, they want us to do our job like they have to do when they sit around their kitchen table and small businesses have to do when they are trying to make ends meet and America's leadership in Washington refuses to do what they have to do." After Republican leadership pushed back on Trump's claim that the bipartisan legislation was a "disgrace", Trump signed the bill, which was attached to a $1.4 trillion spending measure to keep the government running through September 2021.
On January 12, 2021, the House implemented a rule about wearing masks on the floor, with violators to receive a warning and then fines that would be deducted from their salary and could not be paid out of campaign funds or expense accounts. Roy joined about a dozen Republican House members, led by Marjorie Taylor Greene and including Thomas Massie, Lauren Boebert, Ralph Norman, Beth Van Duyne, Louis Gohmert, and Mary Miller, in a protest against mask wearing in the chamber on May 18, 2021. They positioned themselves in front of C-SPAN cameras, grouping together to take selfies and posting them on Twitter. Despite House Republicans' formal effort to set the rule aside on May 19, 2021, it was kept in place, with the Capitol physician reiterating, "Extra precautions are necessary given the substantial number of partially vaccinated, unvaccinated, and vaccine-indeterminate individuals."
Roy was among the Republican House members reprimanded for not wearing a mask on the House floor. He was warned that additional instances would result in $500 fine (with fines going up to $2,500 thereafter). He did not respond to reporters asking whether he had been vaccinated.


=== Foreign relations ===
Roy was one of three House Republicans to vote "present" on a resolution condemning Trump's action of withdrawing forces from Syria. Along with Matt Gaetz and a handful of Republicans, Roy broke with his party and voted to end Saudi assistance to the War in Yemen.
In March 2021, Roy was one of 14 House Republicans to vote against a measure condemning the Myanmar coup d'état (Paul Gosar voted "present"). After the vote, The Washington Post noted a pattern of a small group of House Republicans, including Roy, who on several occasions "objected to what would seem to most observers as an unobjectionable proposal." It described them as an "emerging far-right 'no' caucus …a consistent cohort of House Republicans who are uniting to constitute much of the minority on measures that otherwise pass overwhelmingly. …[united by] staunchly right-wing politics and, in many cases, a penchant for media attention."
In June 2021, Roy was one of 49 House Republicans to vote to repeal the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002.
In September 2021, Roy was among 75 House Republicans to vote against the National Defense Authorization Act of 2022, which contains a provision that would require women to be drafted.
Roy was among 19 House Republicans to vote against the final passage of the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act.
In July 2022, Roy was one of 18 Republicans to vote against ratifying Sweden's and Finland's applications for NATO membership.
In 2023, Roy was among 47 Republicans to vote in favor of H.Con.Res. 21 which directed President Joe Biden to remove U.S. troops from Syria within 180 days.
In December 2023, Roy introduced legislation to withdraw the United States from the United Nations, titled the "Disengaging Entirely from the United Nations Debacle (DEFUND) Act."
On March 19, 2024, Roy voted NAY to House Resolution 149 Condemning the illegal abduction and forcible transfer of children from Ukraine to the Russian Federation. He was one of nine Republicans to do so.


=== Hate crimes against Asian Americans ===
During a congressional hearing held in the wake of a mass shooting in Atlanta that killed eight people, including six Asian-American women, Roy questioned whether the committee's attempts to prevent hate crimes and hate incidents against Asian Americans would hamper free speech. His opening statement also included a remark that appeared to advocate lynching: "There are old sayings in Texas about find all the rope in Texas and get a tall oak tree. We take justice very seriously. And we ought to do that. Round up the bad guys." His statements prompted criticism from Democrats, including Representative Grace Meng, who said, "This hearing was to address the hurt and pain of our community, to find solutions. And we will not let you take our voice from us."
After the hearing, Roy declined to apologize and complained about "Chinese Communists who seek to destroy us", while clarifying that he meant that the discussion should focus on "taking out bad guys" instead of addressing issues like hate speech. Texas GOP chair and former Florida congressman Allen West wrote that Roy's remarks "were inappropriate and unfortunate ... While his comments about hanging were dumb, they're not grounds for resignation ... My recommendation to Congressman Chip Roy would be to engage the brain before firing the mouth ... It would avoid embarrassing situations such as this."
On May 18, 2021, Roy was one of 62 Republicans to vote against a bill that ordered the Department of Justice to expedite the review of COVID-19-related hate crimes reported to law enforcement and help establish ways to report indictments online. The bill also directed the Department of Justice to perform public outreach on the issue, and instructed the Attorney General and the Department of Health and Human Services to issue best-practice guidance on how to mitigate racially discriminatory language for describing the pandemic.
Roy explained his opposition before the vote, saying, "We can't legislate away hate. The perspective of many of us is that we don't need new laws, we don't need more committees, and we don't need more bureaucracy. We need to give our police the resources they need to do their job. We need to make sure that we are rooting out crime wherever it may exist between whatever communities it may exist. We need more emphasis on family, more emphasis on community, more emphasis on the Lord Almighty, and less reliance on the federal government to make our communities better. …The concern of many on my side of the aisle is in this continued sordid business of divvying us up on race and focusing on race. We have spent the better part of the last year rightfully concerned, focused, and outraged on what we saw with respect to Mr. Floyd. But we have had a continued focus on race over the last year, and I think one can look at the impact on communities and the impact on Black communities throughout the United States' cities, businesses that have been closed down, and crime sprees that have occurred and wonder what this continued focus on race is doing to better our great nation."


=== Juneteenth ===
Roy was one of 14 Republicans to vote against the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, which passed, 415–14. The bill recognized as a public holiday a commemoration of June 19, 1865, the day slaves in Galveston, Texas, learned that two and a half years earlier President Abraham Lincoln had issued the Emancipation Proclamation freeing any slave held in rebel states. Roy took issue with the bill's name, saying, "Juneteenth should be commemorated …[but] the holiday should not be called 'Juneteenth National Independence Day' but rather 'Juneteenth National Emancipation (or Freedom or otherwise) Day.' This name needlessly divides our nation on a matter that should instead bring us together by creating a separate Independence Day based on the color of one's skin."


=== Immigration ===
On June 28, 2019, Roy responded to stories of people being turned away after attempting to donate goods (such as diapers, soaps, sanitary wipes, and toys) to migrant children and families being held by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The rejection was due to the Antideficiency Act, which mandates that government agencies cannot accept donations or spend any money other than that allocated by Congress. Roy put forward a bill called the Charitable Donations Freedom Act, which would amend the mandate to allow donations of goods. In response to worries that the wording may be too broad and limit Congressional oversight, Roy said he was willing to "work to make sure it's not either too narrow or too broad." On June 28, 2019, the bill was referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Reform.
In a July 2019 hearing on border detention conditions, in order to emphasize that she was telling the truth, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez asked to be sworn in, taking the role of a witness at a House panel before relating a story about a migrant woman who said she had to drink water from a toilet because her sink broke. In response, Roy accused her of political theatrics and playing to her Twitter followers.
On February 10, 2021, Roy coauthored a letter with 50 other members of Congress criticizing President Joe Biden for refocusing treatment of immigrants under Title 42 health regulations, rather than Title 8, which deals with asylum claims, primarily Homeland Security and Executive Office for Immigration Review matters.
Roy voted against the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act of 2019 which would amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to eliminate the per-country numerical limitation for employment-based immigrants, to increase the per-country numerical limitation for family-sponsored immigrants, and for other purposes.
Roy voted against the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020 which authorizes DHS to nearly double the available H-2B visas for the remainder of FY 2020.
Roy voted against Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1158), which effectively prohibits ICE from cooperating with Health and Human Services to detain or remove illegal alien sponsors of unaccompanied alien children (UACs).
He has received past endorsements from anti-immigration groups such as NumbersUSA and the Federation for American Immigration Reform. Roy has stated that the percentage of the population of the United States in 2024 that is foreign-born is the highest in history. Roy said that this high percentage is a threat to western values, and that the children of immigrants are not being raised to respect the U.S. Constitution and capitalism. In a congressional speech on May 8th 2024 in which Roy warned of the high foreign-born population in the United States, Roy also claimed that there has been a “massive Muslim takeover of the United Kingdom." Roy further said he had "pretty strong concerns about Sharia law and whether that will be forced upon the American people."
In 2024, Roy defended Trump's plan to "deport 20 million people" if elected president by writing on X that he wanted to "ethnic cleanse" white progressive Democrats by deporting them.


=== Gun control ===
Roy is an outspoken critic of gun control, having made several speeches in support of gun rights. The NRA Political Victory Fund has repeatedly given him an "A" rating and endorsement.


=== Earmarks ===
Roy voiced strong opposition to a March 2021 House Republican secret ballot of 102–84 to return earmarks to internal rules, saying, "It is the currency of corruption in Washington. We shouldn't do it. The Republican party should be ashamed of themselves. …I think we've got $30 trillion in debt and people are tired of the swamp and the GOP should be ashamed of itself, if it jumps headfirst right back into the swamp." He signed and circulated a letter along with 17 other members of his conference promising never to request earmarks for their districts.


=== Big Tech ===
In 2022, Roy was one of 39 Republicans to vote for the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act of 2022, an antitrust package that would crack down on corporations for anti-competitive behavior.


=== Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 ===
Roy was among the 71 Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 in the House.


== Electoral history ==


== Personal life ==
Roy met his wife, Carrah, at the University of Texas. They have two children. Roy was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2011.
Roy has said his religious faith informs his political positions, including his opposition to the Equality Act, which he has characterized as trying to prevent his family from being able to "carry out our beliefs without penalty". He has pointed to his generational connection to the Baptist faith, which includes his great-grandfather working as the janitor for the First Baptist Church. Roy is a member of Hyde Park Baptist Church in Austin; the church is part of the Southern Baptists of Texas Convention.

Elizabeth Ann Van Duyne ( van-DYNE; born November 16, 1970) is an American politician serving as the U.S. representative for Texas's 24th congressional district. A member of the Republican Party, she was mayor of Irving from 2011 to 2017. She was an official in the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development during the first Trump administration.


== Early life and education ==
Van Duyne was born in upstate New York and lived in Amsterdam, New York, until she was seven years old and later lived in Cooperstown. In 1986, her family moved to Irving, Texas. She graduated from Greenhill School in Addison, Texas. She also graduated from Cornell University, magna cum laude, where she earned a Bachelor of Arts in city and regional planning, government, and law.


== Career ==

Van Duyne became dissatisfied with Herbert Gears, the Democratic Irving city councillor representing her, over how he handled a zoning case in her neighborhood. She ran against Gears in the 2004 election, and won. Gears was elected mayor in 2005. Van Duyne stepped down from the council in 2010, and successfully ran for mayor against Gears in the 2011 election. She defeated Gears in a rematch in 2014.
In 2015, following an article by Breitbart News that made a false allegation that a court in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex followed Sharia law, Van Duyne pushed for a vote on a resolution in the Irving City Council that expressed support of a bill in the Texas Legislature seeking to ban Sharia law. Also in 2015, when Ahmed Mohamed, a 14-year-old Muslim boy, was arrested for bringing a homemade clock, which teachers thought was a bomb, to school, Van Duyne defended the school's and the Irving Police Department's actions. She was named as a co-defendant in a defamation lawsuit initiated by Mohamed's father. Van Duyne was dismissed from the suit, based partially on the Texas Citizens Participation Act, a state law that "prohibits the use of lawsuits to intimidate or silence citizens and public officials from exercising their right of free speech." The entire suit was eventually dismissed by the judge, who ruled the plaintiffs had failed to prove officials discriminated against Mohamed.
In February 2017, Van Duyne announced that she would not seek a third term as mayor. In May 2017, President Donald Trump appointed Van Duyne as a regional administrator for the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), overseeing Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Louisiana, and Arkansas.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 2020 ====

After Kenny Marchant announced in August 2019 that he would not seek reelection to the United States House of Representatives, Van Duyne resigned from HUD so that she could run to succeed Marchant in representing Texas's 24th congressional district, a suburban stretch between Dallas and Fort Worth, including parts of Denton, Dallas, and Tarrant counties. She received Trump's endorsement in early 2020 and won the Republican primary on March 3, defeating four rivals with about 65% of the vote.
In the general election, Van Duyne faced the Democratic nominee, Candace Valenzuela, a former Carrollton-Farmers Branch school board member. Van Duyne opposed the Affordable Care Act, saying it "has done profound damage to the healthcare of Americans." During the campaign, she ran advertisements in which she said she would protect laws that require preexisting conditions to be covered by insurance. Valenzuela criticized Van Duyne for not wearing a face mask or socially distancing at campaign events, in contradiction to public health guidance at the time. Van Duyne called Valenzuela a "coward" for not campaigning in person during the pandemic, and praised the Trump administration's handling of the public health crisis. On criminal justice reform, Van Duyne stated her opposition to ending cash bail. The Atlantic has described Van Duyne as "the new face of Trumpism in Texas."
On November 3, Van Duyne defeated Valenzuela, 48.8% to 47.5%, even as Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden carried the district by 5 points. According to the Dallas Morning News, Van Duyne focused on public safety and the economy during the campaign. During the campaign, approximately $7.6 million was spent on advertisements against Van Duyne and $7.9 million on advertisements against Valenzuela.


==== 2022 ====
On November 8, Van Duyne defeated Democrat Jan McDowell, 59.75% to 40.25%. McDowell was previously the Democratic nominee for Texas's 24th congressional district in 2016 and 2018, losing both times to Kenny Marchant.
Van Duyne's district was competitive in the 2020 elections, but redistricting maps released by Republicans in 2021 shift the lean of her district to the right by nearly 20 points, making it non-competitive. The proposed maps would draw her 2020 challenger's home out of the district.


=== Tenure ===
Van Duyne is one of 147 Republican lawmakers who voted to overturn results in the 2020 presidential election by objecting to Pennsylvania's electors on January 7, 2021.


=== Political positions ===


==== Ukraine ====
Van Duyne voted against H.R. 7691, the Additional Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2022, which would provide $40 billion in emergency aid to the Ukrainian government.


==== Immigration ====
Van Duyne sponsored H.R. 6202, the American Tech Workforce Act of 2021, introduced by Representative Jim Banks. The legislation would establish a wage floor for the high-skill H-1B visa program, thereby significantly reducing employer dependence on the program. The bill would also eliminate the Optional Practical Training program that allows foreign graduates to stay and work in the United States.


==== 2024 Republican primary ====
Van Duyne was named as part of the 2024 Trump campaign's Texas leadership team in March.


==== Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 ====
Van Duyne was among the 71 Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 in the House.


=== Committee assignments ===
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure
Subcommittee on Aviation
Subcommittee on Highways and Transit
Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings and Emergency Management
Committee on Small Business
Subcommittee on Oversight, Investigations and Regulations (Chair)
Subcommittee on Economic Growth, Tax and Capital Access
Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress


=== Caucus memberships ===
Republican Governance Group


== Personal life ==
Van Duyne met her former husband, Chris "Casey" Wallach, while they were attending Cornell University. They have two children, and divorced in 2012 after being married for 17 years. Van Duyne confirmed she was in a relationship with Georgia congressman Rich McCormick in 2024.
In February 2021, a man died by suicide using a firearm outside of Van Duyne's home in Irving. The man was identified as Richard Christian Dillard, a former communications staffer for Van Duyne's 2020 House campaign.
Van Duyne is an Episcopalian.

John Roger Williams (born September 13, 1949) is an American businessman and politician who has been the U.S. representative for Texas's 25th congressional district since 2013. A member of the Republican Party, he served under Governor Rick Perry as Secretary of State of Texas from 2004 to 2007.


== Early life, education, and business career ==
Williams was born in Evanston, Illinois, in 1949 and raised in Fort Worth. He played college baseball for the Texas Christian University Horned Frogs (TCU) from 1968 to 1971 and was selected in the 25th round of the 1971 MLB Draft by the Atlanta Braves, playing in the farm system and reaching the Class A Western Carolinas League. He coached TCU's baseball team. Williams inherited the family's automobile dealership from his father, who founded the business in 1939.


== Early political career ==
Williams began his political career as a fundraiser for Governor George W. Bush in his 1994 and 1998 elections. He became North Texas Chairman for the Bush/Cheney 2000 campaign, North Texas Finance Chairman in 2004, and National Grassroots Fundraising Chairman for the 2004 campaign.
Governor Rick Perry appointed Williams to be his fourth Secretary of State of Texas in 2004.
On June 11, 2007, Williams announced that he would resign as secretary of state, and late in 2008 he formed an exploratory committee to consider a run for the United States Senate seat held by Kay Bailey Hutchison, who had formed her own committee to consider a 2010 race for governor of Texas. Williams considered a run for Senate in 2012 but decided to run for the House of Representatives instead.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 2012 ====

In June 2011, Williams announced that he was dropping his Senate bid to instead run for Texas's 25th congressional district. The district was a newly drawn district stretching from central Austin to Burleson. Congressional district 25 has been cited as one of Texas's most gerrymandered districts. Williams began residing in the district the year of the election.
Williams ranked first with 25% of the vote and qualified for a runoff election. Wes Riddle ranked second with 15%. In the July 31 runoff, Williams defeated Riddle, 58% to 42%. In the November general election, Williams defeated Democratic nominee Elaine Henderson, 58%–37%.


==== 2014 ====

In the November 4 general election, Williams defeated Democrat Marco Montoya and Libertarian John Betz, receiving 107,120 votes (60.22%) to Montoya's 64,463 (36.24%) and Betz's 6,300 (3.54%). Williams unsuccessfully challenged National Republican Congressional Committee chair Greg Walden of Oregon in Walden's bid for reelection as chair after the election.


==== 2016 ====

Williams won his third term in the House on November 8, when Donald Trump carried the electoral vote majority over Hillary Rodham Clinton. Williams polled 180,988 votes (58.4%) to Democratic nominee Kathi Thomas's 117,073 (37.7%). Libertarian Loren Marc Schneiderman received 12,135 votes (3.9%).


==== 2018 ====

Williams won his fourth term in the House in the general election on November 6. With 162,288 votes (53.6%), he defeated Democratic nominee Julie Oliver, who polled 135,288 (44.7%). Another 5,124 (1.7%) went to the Libertarian Party nominee, Desarae Lindsey.


==== 2020 ====

Williams was reelected with 56% of the vote to Democratic nominee Julie Oliver's 42%. Libertarian nominee Bill Kelsey won 2% of the vote.


=== Tenure ===
In 2015, Williams condemned the Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, which held that same-sex marriage bans violated the constitution.
Williams supported Trump's 2017 executive order imposing a ban on entry to the U.S. to citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, calling it a "commonsense" measure and saying that opponents "are lost in the political correctness of this."
In October 2020, The Houston Chronicle reported that Williams had tried to help a donor in his dealings with a publicly traded bank.


==== 2016 House ethics review ====
On May 3, 2016, the House Ethics Committee initiated an investigation into Williams after he inserted a provision into a $300 billion transportation funding bill, the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act, that exempted some car dealerships like his from a proposal to prevent rental car companies from renting out vehicles that were subject to safety recalls. The legislation was spurred by the deaths of Raechel and Jacqueline Houck, who were killed in 2004 while driving a rented, recalled vehicle that caught fire and crashed into a semi. The investigation's focus was a provision Williams authored that would have exempted dealerships like his and allowed renting vehicles under active safety recall. The independent nonpartisan Office of Congressional Ethics found that Williams violated House ethics rules, noting that he refused to cooperate; by unanimous, bipartisan vote the OCE found that "there is substantial reason to believe that Rep. Williams' personal financial interest in his auto dealership may be perceived as having influenced his performance of official duties—namely, his decision to offer an amendment to the surface transportation legislation". The House Ethics committee determined that the amendment "could have affected Representative Williams' personal financial interests" but decided to end the investigation and took no further action.


==== COVID-19 Paycheck Protection Program loan ====
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Williams's Chrysler Dodge Jeep dealership in Weatherford, Texas, received a loan of between $1 million and $2 million as part of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP); the loan was later forgiven.
U.S. Representative Katie Porter later introduced legislation that would require all loans under the PPP to be made public. The Washington Post highlighted March 2020 comments by Williams in The Epoch Times, where he said, "A socialist wants you to get a check from the government...a capitalist wants you to get a check from the place that you work."
Williams voted against the TRUTH Act (H.R. 6782), a bill that would have required public disclosure of companies that received funds through the bailout program.


==== Texas v. Pennsylvania ====
In December 2020, Williams was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.


==== Financial disclosures ====
In September 2021, nonprofit group Campaign Legal Center filed an ethics complaint against Williams with the Office of Congressional Ethics, claiming that Williams appeared to have violated the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act of 2012, a federal transparency and conflict-of-interest law, by failing to properly disclose sales of stock in General Electric, Nvidia, and The Walt Disney Co. worth between $3,003 and $45,000 made by his wife in 2019.


=== Committee assignments ===
Committee on Small Business Chairman
Committee on Financial Services

== Personal life ==
Williams and his wife Patty live in Weatherford, the seat of Parker County, and have two daughters. He married Patty Jung in 1983 and remained married until her death on January 17, 2025. 
He owns an automobile dealership in Weatherford that he inherited. With a net worth of $27.7 million, Williams was listed as the 22nd wealthiest member of Congress in 2018.
Williams is a trustee of TCU and the George Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University in College Station.
Williams is the coach of the Republican team for the Congressional Baseball Game. On June 14, 2017, he was present during a shooting attack on a practice for the game. He was taken from the area on a stretcher due to an ankle injury he suffered while jumping into the dugout during the attack. A member of his staff was shot and taken to the hospital, where he was treated for a leg injury and released.
Williams has shaken the hand of every President since Harry S. Truman.
Williams is Protestant.

Cloud succeeded Republican Blake Farenthold, who resigned amid controversy due to settling a sexual harassment lawsuit with public money. He won the Republican runoff for the regularly scheduled election with help from the Club for Growth and the endorsement of Ron Paul, who had previously represented parts of the district. On June 30, 2018, he won the special election, defeating Democratic nominee Eric Holguin, 55% to 32%.


==== 2018 regular election ====

Cloud defeated Holguin again in November, along with independent candidate James Duerr and Libertarian candidate Daniel Tinus, with 60.3% of the vote.


==== 2020 ====

Cloud defeated Democratic nominee Ricardo "Rick" De La Fuente and Libertarian candidate Phil Gray with 63.1% of the vote.


=== Tenure ===
Cloud was sworn in on July 10, 2018.
In December 2020, Cloud was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated incumbent Donald Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.
During the 2021 storming of the United States Capitol, Cloud and his colleagues were ushered to a secure location. Later, video footage of him surfaced in which he refused to wear a mask, in violation of House rules.
Cloud was one of 12 House Republicans to vote against HR 1085, to award three Congressional Gold Medals to the United States Capitol Police who protected the Capitol on January 6, 2021. In a statement defending his vote, he said, "I have always stood by and supported our brave law enforcement and still do but this bill was not truly about that, despite its name. Instead of simply being about honoring the Capitol Police who bravely protected the Capitol on January 6th, Speaker Pelosi included damaging language that unnecessarily weighs down the bill. The text refers to the Capitol as the temple of democracy. Simply put, it’s not a temple and Congress should not refer to it as one. The federal government is not a god." In June 2021, Cloud and 20 other House Republicans voted against a similar resolution.
On January 3, 2023, at the beginning of the 118th Congress, Cloud voted for Jim Jordan to be the U.S. House speaker, in rebuke of House minority leader Kevin McCarthy.
Cloud voted to provide Israel with support following 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.


==== Iraq ====
In June 2021, Cloud was one of 49 House Republicans to vote to repeal the AUMF against Iraq.


==== Syria ====
In 2023, Cloud was among 47 Republicans to vote in favor of H.Con.Res. 21 which directed President Joe Biden to remove U.S. troops from Syria within 180 days.


==== Immigration ====
Cloud voted against the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020 which authorizes DHS to nearly double the available H-2B visas for the remainder of FY 2020.
Cloud voted against the Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1158), which effectively prohibits Immigration and Customs Enforcement from cooperating with the Department of Health and Human Services to detain or remove illegal alien sponsors of Unaccompanied Alien Children. He demanded answers in October 2024 from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement regarding a report that found nearly 300,000 migrant children disappeared from tracking.


==== Big Tech ====
In 2022, Cloud was one of 39 Republicans to vote for the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act of 2022, an antitrust package that would crack down on corporations for anti-competitive behavior.


==== Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 ====
Cloud was among the 71 Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 in the House.

John Rice Carter (born November 6, 1941) is the U.S. representative serving Texas's 31st congressional district since 2003. He is a Republican. The district includes the northern suburbs of Austin, as well as Fort Cavazos.


== Early life, education, and career ==
Carter was born in Houston, but has spent most of his life in central Texas. He graduated from Texas Tech University with a degree in history in 1964, and earned a Juris Doctor from the University of Texas School of Law in 1969.
After graduating from law school, Carter served as the first general counsel to the Texas House of Representatives' Agriculture Committee. He later began a private law practice in Round Rock.
In 1981, Carter was appointed as judge of the 277th District Court of Williamson County. He was elected to the post a year later, the first Republican elected to a countywide position in the county. He was reelected four times.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===
Carter retired from the bench in 2001 to run for Congress in the newly created 31st District. After finishing second in the Republican primary, he defeated Peter Wareing in the runoff, which was tantamount to election in what was then a heavily Republican district.
For his first term, 2003–05, Carter represented a district that stretched from the suburbs of Austin to far western Houston, and included College Station, home of Texas A&M University. From the 2003 Texas redistricting until 2013, Carter represented a district stretching from the fringes of the Dallas–Fort Worth Metroplex through more rural portions of Central Texas. Redistricting after the 2010 census, which first affected the 2013–15 term, reduced the 31st to Bell and Williamson counties. The 31st now includes Fort Hood, home of the U.S. Army's 3rd Cavalry Regiment and the 1st Cavalry Division.
In 2016, Carter was reelected with 166,060 votes (58.4%) over Democratic nominee Mike Clark and Libertarian Scott Ballard, who received 103,852 (34.5%) and 14,676 (5.2%), respectively.
In 2018, Carter defeated Democratic nominee MJ Hegar with 144,680 votes (50.6%) to her 136,362 (47.7%). It was the smallest victory margin of his career.


=== Tenure ===
Carter was the sponsor of the Identity Theft Penalty Enhancement Act, which George W. Bush signed into law in 2004.
In the 110th Congress, Carter sponsored and co-sponsored a number of bills, including the Military Spouses Residency Relief Act, the Terrorist Death Penalty Act of 2008, and a bill condemning the vandalism of the Vietnam War Memorial on the National Mall.
On June 12, 2009, Carter co-sponsored H.R. 1503, which would require the production of a birth certificate from presidential candidates. The bill was introduced as a result of conspiracy theories that claimed that President Barack Obama is not a natural-born U.S. citizen.
On September 15, 2009, in an opinion piece published in The Hill, Carter called the 111th Congress a "house of hypocrisy" after the House of Representatives voted to rebuke Representative Joe Wilson for an outburst but would not go after Representative and House Ways and Means Chair Charlie Rangel, who had been the subject of numerous ethical problems involving taxes and property. Carter is also a proponent of the "Rangel Rule," where IRS penalties and interest would be eliminated if one paid back taxes, similar to the treatment Rangel, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, and former Senator (and onetime Secretary of Health and Human Services nominee) Tom Daschle received after their tax problems were publicized.
Carter introduced a "Privileged Resolution" that would have forced Rangel's resignation as chair of the Ways and Means Committee after he declined to resign voluntarily, citing the inaction of the House Democratic Caucus and the ongoing investigations as reasons. The resolution failed largely along party lines, with two Democrats and six Republicans breaking ranks.
Carter amended his financial disclosure forms in October 2009 to list nearly $300,000 in capital gains from the sale of ExxonMobil stock in 2006 and 2007. Though he listed the sale of the assets, he did not list the actual amount of capital gains, on which he did pay taxes.
On November 16, 2009, Carter introduced legislation to give combatant casualty status to the victims of the 2009 Fort Hood shooting, similar to those who were killed in Afghanistan and Iraq.
In 2015, Carter cosponsored a resolution to amend the US constitution to ban same-sex marriage.
On May 16, 2018, Carter was named the new chair of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Subcommittee on Appropriations after Charlie Dent retired. He had previously chaired the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Appropriations.
Carter co-sponsored H.R. 4760, the Securing America's Future Act of 2018, which failed to pass the House.
On December 18, 2019, Carter voted against both articles of impeachment against Trump. Of the 195 Republicans who voted, all voted against both impeachment articles.
On January 6, 2021, Carter voted against certifying the results of the 2020 United States presidential election based on spurious allegations of voter fraud.
Carter was among the 71 Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 in the House.
Carter voted to provide Israel with support following 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.


==== 2024 Republican primary ====
Carter was named as part of the Trump campaign's Texas leadership team in March.

Blake David Moore (born June 22, 1980) is an American politician and former diplomat from the state of Utah. He is the U.S. representative for Utah's 1st congressional district, serving since January 2021. Since November 8, 2023, he has been vice chair of the House Republican Conference.


== Early life and education ==
Moore was born and raised in Ogden, Utah. He attended Ogden High School, graduating in 1998. During high school, he was a quarterback for the football team. In 1997, he won the Wendy's High School Heisman. He is an Eagle Scout.
After graduating from high school, Moore enrolled at Utah State University on a football scholarship. His freshman year roommate was American-born Azerbaijani NBA player Spencer Nelson. During his freshman year, Moore's football scholarship was rescinded by a newly-installed football coach after he left to serve as a missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Seoul, South Korea.
After returning from his mission, Moore transferred to the University of Utah, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in behavioral science and business. He earned a master's in public policy and administration from Northwestern University.


== Career ==
Moore briefly served as a United States Foreign Service officer in the United States Department of State, and worked as a business consultant for the Cicero Group, a management consulting firm based in Salt Lake City.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 2020 ====

In February 2020, Moore declared his candidacy for Utah's 1st congressional district in the 2020 elections. In a field of 12 primary candidates, Moore advanced out of the Republican nominating convention in second place, together with Weber County Commissioner Kerry Gibson. Two other candidates, Davis County commissioner Bob Stevenson and Kaysville mayor Katie Witt, also secured their spot in the primary by gathering signatures. During the party nominating process, Moore was criticized for not living within the congressional district. At the time, he resided on the east bench of Salt Lake City, 15 miles outside the district. Congressional candidates are not required to live inside the district they represent, only in the same state. Moore then won the four-way June 30 Republican primary with just over 30% of the vote.
In the general election, Moore defeated Democratic nominee Darren Parry with 69.5% of the vote to Parry's 30.4%. He took office on January 3, 2021, marking the first time an incumbent had not run in 18 years and maintaining Republican control of the district since 1980.


==== 2022 ====

Moore faced two primary challengers, Tina Cannon and Andrew Badger. On May 15, State Senate President Stuart Adams endorsed Moore in an editorial in the Deseret News.


=== Tenure ===
Moore voted against the second impeachment of Donald Trump.
On May 19, 2021, Moore voted for bipartisan legislation to establish the January 6 commission meant to investigate the attack on the U.S. Capitol. The bill to establish this commission was blocked in the Senate. House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy had earlier advocated for congressional action to form such a commission on January 13, stating that "[he thought] a fact-finding commission ... would be prudent." Moore voted against the Democratic-led United States House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack.
Moore was among the few House Republicans who voted to keep Liz Cheney as conference chair both times a vote was held. In an interview with the Deseret News editorial board, Moore stated he felt no pressure to vote one way or another from Republican leadership, and said it was important for the Republican leadership team to hold "broad appeal."
In July 2021, Business Insider revealed that Moore had failed to disclose on time more than 70 stock and stock-option trades made between mid-January and mid-May 2021, in violation of the STOCK Act. The total value of the stocks in question is unknown, but was between $70,000 and $1.1 million. Moore acknowledged paying a "late filing fee" to the House Committee on Ethics in July 2021; the value of that fee generally starts at $200. In September 2021, Business Insider reported that Moore  failed to disclose an additional three stock-option trades made in August 2021 by a federally mandated deadline.
In November 2021, Moore voted against the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.
In the wake of the Taliban's conquering of Afghanistan, Moore introduced the Afghanistan Accountability Act to investigate what the Biden administration knew before deciding to leave Afghanistan.
As of November 2021, Moore voted with Joe Biden's preferred positions 16% of the time, according to FiveThirtyEight's tracker.
In 2021, Moore co-sponsored the Fairness for All Act, the Republican alternative to the Equality Act. The bill would prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity, and protect the free exercise of religion.
On July 19, 2022, Moore and 46 other Republican Representatives voted for the Respect for Marriage Act, which would codify the right to same-sex marriage in federal law.
On November 8, 2023, Moore defeated six other candidates to become the GOP conference vice chair, the position that was vacated by the ascension of Mike Johnson to the role of Speaker of the House.
In February 2024, Moore voted against the impeachment of Alejandro Mayorkas as part of a procedural move in order to allow the vote to brought again under a motion to reconsider. He would vote in favor of it the second time around.

Celeste Maloy (born May 22, 1981) is an American attorney and Republican politician who is the U.S. representative for Utah's 2nd congressional district. She previously served as chief legal counsel to U.S. Representative Chris Stewart and as the deputy county attorney for Washington County, Utah. Prior to her legal career, Maloy worked as a conservationist for the Natural Resources Conservation Service.


== Early life and education ==
Maloy was born in Cedar City, Utah, and raised in Hiko, Nevada in a single-wide trailer with five siblings; her mother, Cathy (née Turner) sold Avon products, while her father, Edward Maloy, was a volunteer firefighter. She is the niece by marriage of Cliven Bundy and cousin of Ammon Bundy, known for their involvement in the 2014 Bundy standoff. Maloy later graduated from Pahranagat Valley High School in Alamo, Nevada. After graduating high school, Maloy attended Southern Utah University, where she earned her degree in agriculture. She earned a Juris Doctor from J. Reuben Clark Law School at Brigham Young University in 2015.


== Early career ==
Maloy worked for 11 years as a soil conservationist for the Natural Resources Conservation Service in Utah.
After law school, Maloy worked in Washington County, Utah, as a deputy county attorney, specializing in issues of public land law involving land and water policy. She advocated on behalf of Utah landowners to the United States House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. She has continued working with issues of land rights and ownership with the Utah Association of Counties and the Washington County Water Conservancy District. Her work as deputy county attorney in Washington County put her in frequent contact with U.S. Representative Chris Stewart, and in 2019, she was hired by Stewart as chief legal counsel for both his district and Washington, D.C. offices.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 2023 special ====

In June 2023, she announced her candidacy for the special election for Utah's 2nd congressional district after Representative Stewart announced his resignation to care for his wife's health issues. Stewart publicly endorsed Maloy after reports that thirteen Republicans had filed for the contested primary election.
On June 24, 2023, Maloy won the Utah Republican nominating convention for the 2nd district in an upset. However, she still had to face a primary election, as two other candidates had gathered enough signatures to make the primary ballot. Maloy won the most votes in a September 6 primary, to win the Republican nomination over former state Representative Becky Edwards. Maloy faced state Senator Kathleen Riebe in the general election on November 21 and won by a comfortable margin. She was sworn in on November 28, 2023.


==== 2024 ====

Maloy faced multiple challengers in her first re-election bid, with her leading competitor being Colby Jenkins, a telecommunications businessman. Jenkins defeated Maloy at the state convention with 57% of the vote, but Utah law requires that any candidate who receives more than 40% of the vote at convention advance to a primary. The primary was held June 25, 2024, and Maloy won by such a small margin that a recount was automatically triggered.  On August 5, 2024, Utah Lt. Governor Deidre Henderson announced that the recount had confirmed Maloy's victory by 176 votes, allowing Maloy to advance to the general election against Democratic candidate Nathaniel Woodward and Constitiution Party candidate Cassie Easley.

Michael Steven Kennedy (born February 2, 1969) is an American physician, attorney, and politician currently serving as the U.S. representative from Utah’s 3rd congressional district. He previously served as a Republican member of the Utah Senate from 2021 to 2025 and as a member of the Utah House of Representatives from 2013 to 2019. Kennedy was a candidate in the 2018 U.S. Senate election in Utah. He received the most votes at the Utah State Republican Convention but was defeated by Mitt Romney in the subsequent primary for the Republican nomination.
In June of 2024, Kennedy won the Republican nomination for Utah's 3rd congressional district with 39% of the vote in a crowded field of 5 candidates despite being outspent 5-1 and 2-1 by top two competitors. He had previously won the Utah Republican Party nominating convention after six rounds of voting.


== Early life and career ==
Kennedy earned his BS from Brigham Young University. While a student at BYU Kennedy took two years off to serve as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
He earned his MD from Michigan State University, and his JD from Brigham Young University's J. Reuben Clark Law School while taking law classes at night and running his medical practice during the day. Kennedy lives in Alpine, Utah, where he works as a family doctor for Premier Family Medical Group.


== Political career ==
When District 27 incumbent Republican Representative John Dougall ran for state auditor and left the seat open, Kennedy was selected as one of two candidates from five by the Republican convention for the June 26, 2012 Republican primary which he won with 2,586 votes (52.9%) and won the November 6, 2012 general election with 14,335 votes (92.1%) against Constitution candidate Scott Morgan.
During the 2014 general election, Kennedy faced Democratic nominee William McGree, winning with 6,997 votes (88.4%).
During the 2016 legislative session, Kennedy served on the Public Education Appropriations Subcommittee, the House Health and Human Services Committee, and the House Political Subdivisions Committee.
On March 9, 2018, Kennedy distributed a letter to members of District 27 announcing that he would not seek re-election for the Utah House of Representatives. He instead opted to run for the U.S. Senate. On April 22, 2018, Kennedy edged out Mitt Romney at the Republican Convention with 50.88% of the delegate votes. Romney came in a close second with 49.12%, allowing both to compete in the primary on June 26, 2018, but Kennedy would lose the primary to Mitt Romney.
Kennedy drew attention as a vocal supporter of gun rights, even meeting with UtahGunExchange.com, a private gun exchange who would later have a presence at March For Our Lives near the Utah Capitol and the 2018 Chicago Peace March and Rally, where their militaristic vehicle included a replica .50-caliber machine gun.
Kennedy announced his candidacy for Utah's 3rd congressional district on January 4th, 2024, two days after the district's Representative John Curtis announced his candidacy for the United States Senate.

A Republican, Kiggans is a former United States Navy helicopter pilot. She defeated incumbent Elaine Luria in the 2022 election and was re-elected in 2024.


== Early life and career ==
Kiggans was born in Tampa, Florida, and graduated from high school in Orlando, Florida. As a high school student, she worked at Walt Disney World. She is an alumna of Boston University. In 1993 and 1994, she taught English in Japan through the JET Programme. She also lived in Japan as a Navy spouse for five years.

In 2019, Kiggans ran for the Virginia Senate for the 7th district, which was being vacated by Republican incumbent Frank Wagner. In the Republican Party primary, Kiggans defeated Virginia Beach School Board member Carolyn Weems, 52% to 48%.
In the general election, Kiggans faced Democratic state Delegate Cheryl Turpin. The race was viewed as competitive, as the district had very narrowly favored Democrats in recent statewide elections. Kiggans and Turpin each spent over $500,000 on television advertisements. Kiggans won, 50.4% to 49.5%.
The Washington Post reported that "Her record didn't always fit neatly along a party line." She voted to expand nondiscrimination protections for LGBTQ people and for environmental protection measures.

==== 2020 presidential election ====
According to The Washington Post, Kiggans "has never beat a 'stolen election' drum", but has hesitated to acknowledge Joe Biden as a legitimate president. She called for a forensic audit of Virginia's 2020 presidential election results; a previous audit of those results found no evidence of fraud. She has said that she does not believe the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago was justified.


==== Abortion ====
Kiggans supports banning abortions after fifteen weeks of pregnancy, except for in cases of rape, incest, or to protect the life of the mother. In June 2022, she expressed support for the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which overruled Roe v. Wade.

John Joseph McGuire III (born August 24, 1968) is an American politician, businessman, and former United States Navy SEAL serving as the U.S. representative for Virginia's 5th congressional district since 2025. A member of the Republican Party, he previously served in the Virginia Senate from 2024 to 2025 and in the Virginia House of Delegates from 2018 to 2024.
McGuire was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates in 2017, and represented the old 56th district which comprised areas to the North and West of Richmond, Virginia. He was then elected to the newly redrawn 10th Senate district in 2023.
McGuire was the Republican nominee for the United States House of Representatives in Virginia's 5th congressional district in the 2024 election, having  defeated the incumbent Bob Good in the primary. The final vote tally saw McGuire beating Good by 374 votes, with election results being certified on July 2. McGuire's win was upheld in a recount requested by Good. McGuire, on November 5, won against his Democratic opponent Gloria Witt. He assumed office on January 3, 2025, succeeding Bob Good.


== Early career ==
McGuire served as a United States Navy SEAL. Overcoming severe injuries from a trampoline accident, McGuire founded a physical training business, SEAL Team Physical Training, that has been employed by Virginia Commonwealth University sports teams.


== Political career ==
In 2017, McGuire ran for the Virginia House of Delegates for the 56th district, then held by retiring Republican incumbent Peter Farrell. He told the Richmond Times-Dispatch that his main motivation for running was that he was "interested in growing businesses in Virginia and wants to continue providing support for veterans and law enforcement officers."
McGuire won a hotly contested June 2017 Republican primary with 31% of the vote, defeating five other candidates. McGuire won the endorsement of Virginia Right! Blog, which noted he "came back from a horrible accident to walk and live a decent life again," as well as his Navy service and conservative views. McGuire was attacked for allegedly moving into the 56th district for the race, although this was disputed by McGuire and supporters.
In the general election, McGuire defeated health care consultant Melissa Dart by a 60% to 40% margin, despite a fundraising disadvantage, the Democrats' huge 2017 statewide gains, and Hillary Clinton's 2016 victory among district voters.
McGuire spent his first two years with Republicans holding a narrow majority in the House of Delegates.  His bill to put veterans' ID on Virginia drivers' licenses won approval and was signed into law. Running for re-election in 2019, McGuire cited "giving teachers a 5% pay raise without raising your taxes while balancing the budget" as the key legislative achievement of his first two years, and "Jobs, the opioid crisis, and education" as the three top issues facing the next general Assembly.
In October 2019, while campaigning for re-election, McGuire declined to commit to completing his second term in office, responding to widespread speculation that he was considering a congressional campaign. After winning re-election in November, McGuire announced his candidacy for U.S. Congress for Virginia's 7th congressional district. McGuire lost a closely contested convention to state Delegate Nick Freitas, who went on to narrowly lose to Abigail Spanberger in the 2020 election.
McGuire publicly opposed Virginia's ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment, pointing out that the resolution had missed the deadline for ratification.
McGuire attended Stop the Steal rallies throughout Virginia in 2020. He has claimed the COVID-19 pandemic was a "plan-demic" designed to change voting laws and rig the 2020 presidential election. McGuire admitted to attending President Donald Trump's January 6, 2021 rally in Washington, D.C., but has denied participating in the subsequent attack on the United States Capitol.
McGuire declared his candidacy for the U.S. Congress in 2024, having been recruited by allies of former Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy to challenge Bob Good as part of what Politico described as a "vengeance operation" against those who voted to oust him.

Howard Morgan Griffith (born March 15, 1958) is an American lawyer and politician who has been the U.S. representative for Virginia's 9th congressional district since 2011. The district covers most of Southwest Virginia, including the New River Valley and the Virginia side of the Tri-Cities. He is a member of the Republican Party and the Freedom Caucus.
Griffith was the majority leader of the Virginia House of Delegates and represented the 8th district from 1994 to 2011. The district was based in his hometown of Salem and included parts of surrounding Roanoke County.


== Early life, education, and career ==
Griffith was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and in his infancy his family relocated to Salem, Virginia. He graduated from Andrew Lewis High School in 1976 and from Emory and Henry College in 1980 with a Bachelor of Arts. Griffith completed his education with a J.D. from the Washington and Lee University School of Law in 1983.
After law school, Griffith settled in Salem, where he worked as an attorney in private practice specializing in traffic violations and DUI. On June 23, 2008, Albo & Oblon LLP, a law firm run by fellow Republican delegate Dave Albo, announced that Griffith had joined the firm as head of its new Roanoke/Salem office.


== Early political career ==
Griffith's first entry into electoral politics came in 1986, when he was chosen as chair of the Salem Republican Party. He chaired the party from 1986 to 1988 and from 1991 to 1994.


== Virginia House of Delegates ==
In 1993, incumbent Delegate G. Steven Agee chose to run in the Republican primary for Attorney General. Griffith ran for the open seat representing the 8th district and won. He was elected to several terms, facing opposition only in 2001, 2003, and 2009. He served as vice chair of the Rules Committee and on the Courts of Justice Committee, and chaired its Criminal Law Subcommittee. He also served on the Commerce and Labor Committee, and the Committee on Militia, Police, and Public Safety. He was elected House Majority Leader in 2000, the first Republican to hold that position in Virginia's history.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 2010 ====

Rather than run for a tenth term in the House of Delegates, Griffith opted to challenge Congressman Rick Boucher, a 13-term incumbent Democrat who had served since 1983. His home in Salem was just outside the 9th's borders at the time, but the district included almost all of his House of Delegates district.
Griffith chose to run for Congress after Boucher voted for the cap and trade bill. Boucher capitalized on the fact that Griffith did not live in the district, and in return Griffith branded Boucher as a rubber stamp for Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi. Griffith won the election by less than 5% of the vote.


==== 2012 ====

Griffith defeated Democratic nominee Anthony Flaccavento, 61.3% to 38.6%.


==== 2016 ====

Griffith defeated Democratic nominee Derek Kitts and Independent Janice Boyd with 68.59% of the vote.


==== 2018 ====

Griffith defeated two Democratic opponents, Flaccavento and Justin Santopietro, and a Whig opponent, Scott Blankenship.


==== 2020 ====

Griffith ran unopposed. He was reelected with 94.39% of the vote.
2024

Griffith defeated Democratic nominee Karen Baker. He was reelected with 72.5% of the vote.


=== Committee assignments ===
Committee on Energy and Commerce
Subcommittee on Energy
Subcommittee on Health
Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations


=== Caucus memberships ===
Congressional Constitution Caucus
Congressional Caucus on Turkey and Turkish Americans

Freedom Caucus
Liberty Caucus
Friends of Wales Caucus


== Electoral history ==


== Political positions ==


=== Iraq ===
In June 2021, Griffith was one of 49 House Republicans to vote to repeal the Authorization of Military Force against Iraq. The measure ultimately succeeded in the House and has been pending in the Senate since then.


=== Syria ===
In 2023, Griffith was among 47 Republicans to vote in favor of H.Con.Res. 21, which directed President Joe Biden to remove U.S. troops from Syria within 180 days.


=== Immigration ===
Griffith has voted to allow Virginia to enforce federal immigration laws to criminalize knowingly employing illegal immigrants or undocumented workers, and also voted to criminalize possession of firearms by illegal aliens.
Griffith voted against the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020 which authorizes the Department of Homeland Security to nearly double the available H-2B visas for the remainder of FY 2020.
Griffith voted against the Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1158), which effectively prohibits Immigration and Customs Enforcement from cooperating with the Department of Health and Human Services to detain or remove illegal alien sponsors of Unaccompanied Alien Children. The measure was approved by both houses of Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump on December 10, 2019.


=== Gay rights ===
While serving in the Virginia House of Delegates, Griffith supported a constitutional amendment to prohibit same-sex marriage by defining marriage as between one man and one woman. He voted in favor of a motion to effectively kill a bill to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation for government employees in Virginia.


=== Environment ===
In 2017, Griffith voted to nullify the Stream Protection Rule, which included improvements in the protection of water supplies, water quality, streams, fish and other wildlife that can be negatively affected by surface coal mining. The same year, he joined other members of the House of Representatives in passing an amendment to H.R. 3354, which undermined the Environmental Protection Agency’s ability to enforce environmental standards in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, which covers six states and the District of Columbia.
Griffith is a proponent of "an 'all of the above' energy strategy" that utilizes both fossil fuel and renewable energy sources. In 2011, he joined other GOP members in urging Interior Secretary Ken Salazar to reconsider the ban on offshore drilling off Virginia's coast.


=== Gun rights ===
Griffith voted in favor of several bills to reduce restrictions on gun ownership, including a bill to allow concealed weapons in vehicles without a permit and to allow concealed weapons permit holders to carry their firearms in restaurants and bars. He also voted to prohibit consumption of alcohol while in possession of a concealed weapon. In 2004 Griffith voted to prohibit carrying firearms or ammunition in non-secure areas of airport terminals, including baggage claim areas.


=== Health care ===
Early in 2010, Griffith voted in favor of a bill to prohibit any individual mandate to purchase health insurance. This law passed Virginia's legislature before the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was enacted, which Virginia has used to challenge the individual mandate in federal court. On July 17, 2013, Griffith was the lone GOP member of the House to vote against delaying the implementation of the individual mandate.
Just before the United States federal government shutdown of 2013, Griffith issued a press release in which he endorsed the final House version of Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2014, which would have continued funding for federal government operations while delaying implementation of the Affordable Care Act. He voted against the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014, the Senate-proposed compromise that ended the shutdown without defunding the ACA.


=== Death penalty ===
Griffith has consistently voted for expansions of the death penalty to include eligibility for accomplices to a murder, as well as for those who murder a judge or a witness.


=== Abortion ===
When surveyed in 1999 on his political positions by Project Vote Smart, Griffith indicated that he supports legalized abortion in the first trimester and to save the life of the mother, while favoring the restriction of abortion through parental notification laws and prohibition of partial-birth abortion. His voting record has generally been consistent with that survey, voting in favor of restrictions such as parental-notification and parental-consent, restricting state funding of abortions, and requiring abortion clinics to meet the same licensing requirements as surgical centers. In 2006 Griffith voted to restrict state funding for fetal stem cell research.
In 2007 Griffith voted against a bill in the Virginia General Assembly, HB 2797, which stated "That life begins at the moment of fertilization and the right to enjoyment of life guaranteed by Article 1, § 1 of the Constitution of Virginia is vested in each born and preborn human being from the moment of fertilization".
Griffith's 2010 campaign website reported that Griffith has a "100% pro-life" voting record and an "A" rating from the Virginia Society for Human Life (VSHL). But VSHL's report on 2007 legislation in Virginia omits reference to HB 2797. Project Vote Smart indicated that Griffith declined to retake their survey in 2010.


=== Taxes and spending ===
Griffith supports raising the retirement age and reducing the number of American troops serving overseas as means of reducing the federal budget deficit. Most recently, he voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.


=== Medical marijuana ===
In 2014, Griffith introduced legislation to move marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule II narcotic, which would effectively make the drug legal for medical purposes under federal law.


=== Texas v. Pennsylvania ===
In December 2020, Griffith was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated incumbent Donald Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.
Presidential election certification
On January 6, 2021, Griffith was one of the 147 Republican members of Congress who objected to certifying the 2020 presidential election.


=== Defense ===
In September 2021, Griffith was among 75 House Republicans to vote against the National Defense Authorization Act of 2022, which contains a provision that would require women to be drafted.
Griffith was among 19 House Republicans to vote against the final passage of the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act.


=== Big Tech ===
In 2022, Griffith was one of 39 Republicans to vote for the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act of 2022, an antitrust package that would crack down on corporations for anti-competitive behavior.


=== Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 ===
Griffith was among the 71 Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 in the House.

Michael James Baumgartner ( BAHM-gart-nər, born December 13, 1975) is an American politician and former diplomat currently serving as the U.S. representative from Washington's 5th congressional district, a post he has held since 2025. Baumgartner, a Republican, previously served as the 28th Spokane County Treasurer and as a member of the Washington State Senate, representing the 6th district from 2011 to 2019 and was his party's nominee in the 2012 election for the United States Senate, unsuccessfully challenging Democratic incumbent Maria Cantwell.
On February 26, 2024, Baumgartner announced his intention to run for the United States House of Representatives' in Washington's 5th congressional district to succeed Cathy McMorris-Rodgers, who did not seek reelection. In August and November 2024, he won and placed first in both the primary and general elections respectively.


== Early life, education, and career ==

Baumgartner was born in Pullman. His mother is a kindergarten teacher and his father was a professor of Forestry and Natural Resource Sciences. After graduating from Pullman High School, he earned a scholarship to attend Washington State University. There, he was awarded a Thomas Foley scholarship, and was named a Stephenson scholar, an award given to the top graduates from the Honors College. He graduated in 1999 with a degree in economics with minors in French and mathematics. In 2002, he earned a master's degree in public administration from Harvard University.
After graduating from Harvard, Baumgartner, a Catholic, volunteered on a Gonzaga Jesuit mission to Mozambique and studied forests in Siberia.
During the Iraq War, he served as the economics officer in the Office of Joint Strategic Planning & Assessment (JSPA) at the United States Embassy in Baghdad, helping the Iraqi government as part of the Baghdad Security Plan, receiving accolades from then General David Petraeus as well as Ambassador Ryan Crocker. In 2008, he spent 7 months working as a civilian contractor in the Helmand Province of Afghanistan. That same year, Boston Globe columnist Kevin Cullen referred to Baumgartner as an "Architect of Hope" in Iraq.
After leaving Iraq, Baumgartner worked as a civilian contractor in Helmand Province, Afganistan, where encouraged poppy farmers to grow food instead, in an effort to combat the opioid epidemic. He would meet his wife Eleanor Mayne, a journalist studying counternarcotics in Helmand Province, and the two were married in 2010.


== Washington State Senate ==

Baumgartner represented parts of the City of Spokane, Airway Heights, and Cheney including Eastern Washington University. (map)


=== Elections ===
In 2010, Baumgartner returned to Eastern Washington and was planning a trip with his future wife Eleanor “to see if we actually like each other," when he was approached by Cathy McMorris Rodgers' Chief of Staff and future Spokane Mayor David Condon, who recruited him to run against incumbent Democratic State Senator and Majority Whip Chris Marr for the Washington State Senate 6th Legislative District seat. On August 17, 2010, in the state primary election, Baumgartner defeated Marr with 53% of the vote. In the November election, he officially defeated Marr with 54% of the vote. The election battle between Marr and Baumgartner is considered the most hotly contested and expensive state legislative races in Washington state history.

In 2014, Baumgartner ran for re-election to the State Senate, easily winning.


=== Tenure ===

During his tenure as Washington State Senator, Baumgartner has sponsored keynote legislation such as an amendment to the Washington State Senate to rise Higher Education to the State's #2 focus, reorganizing and streamlining central service functions, powers, and duties of the State Government, and reforming the rule-making process for State Economic Policy (the latter two receiving 47–0 votes in the State Senate).
In 2012 Baumgartner was named one of the National Federation of Independent Business's Guardians of Business, the highest award they offer, in recognition of his votes that side "100 Percent" with small businesses. The Association of Washington Business has awarded him their 'Cornerstone Award' also, in recognition of his support for employers, economic development, and business-related issues in the Washington State Legislature.
In 2015, Baumgartner was awarded the "Legislator of The Year" award by anti-tax activist Tim Eyman due to his consistent effort to fight tax increases proposed in the state legislature.
During the 2016 presidential election primaries, Baumgartner chaired Scott Walker's campaign for president in the state of Washington.


=== Committee assignments ===
In 2011 and 2012, Baumgartner was the ranking minority member of the Economic Development Trade & Innovation Committee, served on the Ways & Means Committee, and the Higher Education & Workforce Development Committee.
In 2013, two Democrats joined with the 23 Republicans to form the Majority Coalition Caucus. With the new coalition, Baumgartner was named Vice-Chairman of the Senate Ways and Means Committee, and was also assigned to the Senate Trade and Economic Development Committee, the Higher Education Committee, and the Human Services and Corrections Committee.


== 2012 U.S. Senate election ==

In October 2011, Baumgartner decided to challenge incumbent U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA). Cantwell was running for her third term. Washington uses a "top-two" nonpartisan blanket primary system, in which the top two candidates of any party in the primary election advance to the general election. Cantwell and Baumgartner finished first and second, respectively, and competed in the general election.
Baumgartner has formally endorsed Washington Initiative 502 to legalize, regulate and tax marijuana for adults 21 and over, making him the first and only candidate for statewide office in Washington state to do so, and taking a position that wasn't popular in his party.
In the November general election, Cantwell defeated Baumgartner. Cantwell received over 60% of the vote, to Baumgarter's 40%.


== Spokane County Treasurer ==
In 2018, Baumgartner opted not to run for reelection to the State Senate. Instead, he chose to run for Spokane County Treasurer. He won the November election and took office in January 2019.  He was unopposed for reelection in 2022.


=== Elections ===

In 2022, Baumgartner ran for re-election and won unopposed.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==

On February 26, 2024, shortly after incumbent Congresswoman Cathy McMorris-Rodgers announced she would not seek re-election, Baumgartner announced he would run for Washington's 5th congressional district. While no public polling was conducted, Baumgartner was largely seen as the early favorite for the Republican nomination.
On August 6, 2024, Baumgartner won the primary for the open seat, placing first, with Democrat Carmela Conroy placing second. He received 28.4% of the vote to Conroy's 19.5%
On November 5, 2024, Baumgartner officially won the race for the district with over 60% of the vote. Notably, he outperformed predecessor Cathy McMorris Rogers' result in 2022, despite not being an incumbent. He was the best performing Republican out of any candidate in the state, both federally and statewide.


=== Results ===


== Notable achievements and votes ==
During his tenure in the State Senate, Baumgartner fought to improve infrastructure in Eastern Washington, including securing the $900 million funding needed to complete the north–south corridor route first proposed sixty years ago, being the sole local Republican to support the major transportation package, helping lead successful efforts to build a new medical school in Spokane which addressed physician shortages in underserved and rural areas of Eastern Washington, which contributed to boosting healthcare economy jobs growth. The medical school, which was directed to be spearheaded by Washington State University, was originally blocked due to a 100-year old law that had given the University of Washington a monopoly on training doctors in the state. Baumgartner lead efforts to repeal the law, ultimately being successful in 2015.
Baumgartner considered public education a top priority during his tenure and led efforts to halt increases and reduce tuition for public universities by 20% in Washington State in 2015, including the University of Washington and Washington State University. It is currently the largest successful tuition reduction in the country's history. He has consistently fought for charter schools, which received significant opposition from the Washington State teachers’ union Washington Education Association.
One of Baumgartner's most notable personal efforts was in 2016, when he took an outspoken stand against the expulsion of an American Samoan student, Robert Barber, from Washington State University. Barber had been only one credit short of a college degree when he was accused of involvement in a brawl. Baumgartner told a meeting of WSU regents: "If you don’t fix this, I goddamn will." Barber was reinstated to the student body, and was later found innocent of all criminal charges.
In February 2018, Baumgartner was one of a handful of Washington State legislators to vote against a bill that would have exempted legislators from public records rules.
In the final year of his tenure, 2018, the Washington Policy Center think-tank announced that Baumgartner would be presented with their prestigious "Champion of Freedom" award, in recognition "for his outstanding commitment to free-market principles, worker rights and limited government, particularly in advancing labor reform in our state. WPC’s board chose Baumgartner for this award in recognition of his "unwavering principled stand on numerous key issues during his many years in the State Senate."
Concluding the 2018 legislative session, Baumgartner introduced a satirical resolution calling for April 1 to be celebrated as "Governor Jay Inslee Integrity Day", mocking the Governor for his about-turn on vetoing public records legislation.

Challenging District 15 Democratic representatives Margarette Leach, Kevin Craig, and Jim Morgan, Miller placed in the four-way three-selectee 2004 Republican primary, but lost the six-way three-position general election. (All the incumbents were reelected.)
Challenging the incumbents again, Miller placed in the six-way three-selectee 2006 Republican primary and was elected in the six-way three-position general election, unseating Leach. Craig and Morgan were reelected.
Miller placed first in the three-way Republican primary on May 13, 2008, with 2,116 votes (43.8%).

==== 2022 ====

As a result of redistricting after the 2020 United States Census, Miller's district was renumbered as the 1st district. With West Virginia losing a district, the state ended its longstanding scheme of numbering districts from north to south, instead having the 1st district in the south and the 2nd district in the north. Miller retained all the counties in the old 3rd, while gaining the ten southernmost counties from the old 2nd (including Kanawha County, home to Charleston) and one county from the old 1st.

Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated incumbent Donald Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, auto dealerships owned by Miller's husband received loans of over $3 million as part of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP); the loans were later forgiven. Miller voted against the TRUTH Act (H.R. 6782), a bill that would have required public disclosure of companies that received funds through the bailout program.
In September 2022, Business Insider reported that Miller had violated the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act of 2012, a federal transparency and conflict-of-interest law, by failing to properly disclose 21 stock trades made by her husband in 2021 worth between $217,021 and $805,000.
Miller opposes free trade and supports an America First policy approach on trade that ends trade deals that send jobs overseas.

Fitzgerald was elected to the Wisconsin Senate in 1994, when he unseated Republican incumbent Barbara Lorman in a three-way Republican primary election, with 6,098 votes for Fitzgerald, 5,613 for Herbert Feil and 5,494 votes for Lorman. He was reelected six times, serving until he joined Congress in 2021. His Republican colleagues elected him majority leader for the 2011–12 legislative session, and he served as leader of the chamber's Republicans for the rest of his time in the legislature. In prior sessions, Fitzgerald served as minority leader, co-chair of the Joint Committee on Finance, and chair of the Senate Corrections Committee. His constituency included much of the Beaver Dam micropolitan statistical area and parts of the Madison and Milwaukee metropolitan areas, stretching across most of Dodge County and parts of Columbia, Dane, Jefferson, Washington, and Waukesha Counties.


=== 2011 Wisconsin protests ===

In 2011, public employees protested Governor Scott Walker's budget repair bill. In January 2011, Fitzgerald said he wanted to meet with the unions before changing the laws, adding, "We're not going to walk through hell and go through that if the governor doesn't offer that up."
On February 8, 2011, the Walker administration appointed Fitzgerald's father to head the state patrol. Three days later, Walker introduced his budget repair bill, which limited collective bargaining from most public workers, but not law enforcement officers such as state patrol. Fitzgerald and all but one Republican in the State Senate supported Walker's bill.


=== Gerrymandering ===
In 2011, Wisconsin Republicans drew the state's legislative map with 99 Assembly and 33 Senate districts. In 2016, a three-judge panel ruled this map an "unconstitutional gerrymander". In response, Fitzgerald and Wisconsin Republicans hired attorney Paul Clement to fight this ruling before the Supreme Court. As of 2016, the state has spent over $2 million to defend the legislative maps.


=== Limiting powers of the Evers administration ===
After the 2018 elections, in which Democrats were elected governor, attorney general and secretary of state in Wisconsin, Fitzgerald pushed for legislation to take select powers away from the incoming administration. The legislation would also reduce the time allowed for early voting in Wisconsin election. Courts struck down a similar law that curbed early voting in 2016, ruling that the law "intentionally discriminates on the basis of race" and that it was "stifling votes for partisan gain." The bill would also prevent the incoming administration from withdrawing from a lawsuit seeking to repeal the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) by taking the power to do so away from the governor and giving it to the legislature. Fitzgerald described concern over the stripping of power as "manufactured outrage by the Democrats". He justified the attempt to curb the incoming administration's powers, saying, "state legislators are the closest to those we represent" and suggesting that urban voters (who are more likely to vote for Democrats) do not reflect the real electorate.


=== COVID-19 pandemic ===

In April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Fitzgerald opposed calls by Governor Tony Evers to delay an election from early April to late May, to make it an entirely mail-in election, and to mail ballots to all registered voters. Due to the pandemic, it was estimated that many voters would be effectively disenfranchised, and in-person voting was also considered a public health risk. According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Fitzgerald "had no answer to how local election officials are supposed to keep people safe as a massive shortage of poll workers has resulted in the closure or reduction of polling locations, forcing more people to vote at a single site."
Due to Wisconsin legislature's slowness to waive a requirement that unemployed Wisconsites wait a week before they can be reimbursed unemployment benefits, Wisconsin lost $25 million in federal funding from the federal CARES Act. Fitzgerald and Assembly speaker Robin Vos were warned that this would happen unless they passed the waiver.
Amid the pandemic, Fitzgerald said he opposed a statewide face mask mandate. He supported a lawsuit against Evers for implementing a face mask mandate to hinder the virus's spread. The state legislature could convene a session to strike down Evers's mandate, but Republicans opted to let the courts strike down the mandate so as to prevent vulnerable Republican legislators from having to vote against face mask mandates just before an election.


=== Veterans ===
The PACT ACT which expanded VA benefits to veterans exposed to toxic chemicals during their military service, received a "nay" from Fitzgerald. Regarding cannabis, despite lobbying from VSOs such as the DAV, Fitzgerald also voted against the 2022 MORE Act.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 2020 ====

In September 2019, Fitzgerald announced he would run for Wisconsin's 5th congressional district. The announcement came two weeks after 21-term incumbent Jim Sensenbrenner announced his retirement. Fitzgerald's state senate district was largely coextensive with the congressional district's eastern portion. He did not have to give up his state senate seat to run for Congress; state senators serve staggered four-year terms, and Fitzgerald was not up for reelection until 2022.
It was initially thought that the Republican primary–the real contest in what has long been the most Republican district in Wisconsin–would attract a crowded field, but Republicans quickly cleared the field for Fitzgerald; according to the Cook Political Report, he was the only substantive candidate in the field when nominations closed. He won the primary with 77% of the vote.
In October 2020, Fitzgerald's campaign was penalized for accepting excessive campaign contributions but did not pay the $3,600 settlement. According to the Wisconsin State Journal, the penalty was paid by the Committee to Elect a Republican Senate.


=== Tenure ===

Fitzgerald was among the 120 members of the United States House of Representatives, all Republicans, to object to counting Arizona's and Pennsylvania's electoral votes in the 2020 presidential election. Representative Tom Tiffany also objected.
Fitzgerald voted to provide Israel with support following 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.


=== Committee assignments ===
Committee on the Judiciary
Committee on Education and Labor
Committee on Small Business


=== Caucus memberships ===
Republican Study Committee


== Family ==
Fitzgerald's father, Stephen "Steve" Fitzgerald, was Sheriff of Dodge County, Wisconsin, for 14 years and served as the U.S. marshal for the Western District of Wisconsin. Walker later appointed him head of the Wisconsin State Patrol.
Fitzgerald's younger brother, Jeff, represented the 39th Assembly District, covering the northeastern portion of Scott's state senate district. In Wisconsin, state senate districts are formed by combining three neighboring state assembly districts. Jeff was Assembly Speaker during the 2011–12 legislative session.


== Personal life ==
Fitzgerald and his wife, Lisa, have three sons. He owns a ranch in Montana. He is Roman Catholic.

Glenn Sholes Grothman ( GROHTH-mən; born July 3, 1955) is an American attorney and politician serving as the U.S. representative from Wisconsin's 6th congressional district. A member of the Republican Party, he was first elected to his seat in 2014.
Grothman represented the 58th district in the Wisconsin State Assembly from 1993 until 2005 and was vice chair of the Assembly's Republican caucus from 1999 to 2004. He represented the 20th district in the Wisconsin Senate from 2005 to 2015, and was the assistant majority leader from 2011 to 2015.


== Early life and education ==
Grothman graduated from Homestead High School in Mequon in 1973. In 1978, he graduated from the University of Wisconsin–Madison with a BBA degree. He received a Juris Doctor from the University of Wisconsin Law School in 1983, was admitted to the bar, and became an attorney with a firm in West Bend, Wisconsin.


== Wisconsin legislature ==


=== Elections ===
Grothman was elected to the Wisconsin 58th Assembly District in a special election in December 1993 to succeed Mary Panzer, who had won a special election for the state senate. He was reelected five times, from 1994 to 2002. From 1999 to 2004, he was vice chairman of the Republican caucus.
In 2004, Grothman ran for the state senate seat in the 20th district, challenging Panzer, who had by then risen to state senate majority leader, in the Republican primary. The district included the city of West Bend, other parts of Washington County, and parts of Fond du Lac, Dodge, Sheboygan, and Ozaukee Counties.
Running well to Panzer's right, Grothman won the nomination with 79% of the vote to Panzer's 21%. He was unopposed in the general election in the heavily Republican district, and reelected in 2008 and 2012.


=== Tenure ===

From 2007 to 2008, Grothman was the Senate Minority Caucus Chair. He became the assistant Republican leader in 2009, serving as assistant minority leader from 2009 to 2010 and as assistant majority leader from 2011 to 2015.
Grothman was a member of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC).


=== 2011 Wisconsin budget protests ===

Grothman was a vocal proponent of SB11, a controversial bill proposed by Governor Scott Walker in early 2011. He said he supported the  budget repair bill because it was fiscally responsible. In a press interview, he said he did not "find it impressive" that over 70,000 protesters had marched on the Capitol.
During the protests, Grothman was cornered by almost 200 pro-union protesters yelling "Shame! Shame!" outside the Capitol. He said he was not concerned about violence at the time, adding, "They're loud, they'll give you the finger, and they yell at you, but I really think deep down inside they're just mostly college kids having fun, just like they're having fun sleeping with their girlfriends on air mattresses. That's the guts of that crowd." He also called the protesters "a different breed of person" and "a bunch of slobs taking up the building."
During this time, Grothman advocated that the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources hire more business-friendly people. In doing so, he went out of his way to single out one University of Wisconsin campus as a target: "Maybe you look to hire those people who know what the real world is like, rather than a recent graduate from UW-Stevens Point who doesn't know what the real world is like." This was only days before he appeared at UW–Stevens Point with the Joint Finance Committee for a day of hearings on Walker's budget bill.
Grothman was subject to a recall effort in the spring of 2011, but the effort failed, collecting only 75% of the required signatures.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===


==== 2014 ====

On April 3, 2014, Grothman announced he would run in that year's Republican primary for Wisconsin's 6th congressional district against 17-term incumbent Tom Petri. He positioned himself well to Petri's right; in his campaign announcement he called Petri a "decent, genial person" who lacked the "sense of urgency" to put more curbs on "a federal government that seems to be out of control." Grothman did not have to give up his state senate seat to run for Congress; state senators serve staggered four-year terms, and he was not up for reelection until 2016. Shortly after Grothman entered the race, Petri dropped out.
Grothman's longtime home in West Bend was in the 5th District, represented by Jim Sensenbrenner, but his state senate district included much of the southeastern part of the 6th congressional district. In the summer of 2014, Grothman moved to Campellsport, a suburb of Fond du Lac, which is in the 6th District.
In the general election, Grothman defeated the Democratic nominee, Winnebago County Executive Mark Harris, with 57% of the vote to Harris's 41%.


==== 2016 ====
Grothman was reelected over Democratic nominee Sarah Lloyd, getting 57% of the vote to Lloyd's 37%.


==== 2018 ====

Grothman was reelected over Democratic nominee Dan Kohl, getting 55.5% of the vote to Kohl's 44.5%.


==== 2020 ====

Grothman was reelected over Democratic nominee Jessica King, getting 59.23% of the vote to King's 40.72%.


==== 2022 ====

Grothman had only token opposition from Douglas Mullenix in the Republican primary, and ran unopposed in the general election.


=== Committee assignments ===
Committee on the Budget
Committee on Education and the Workforce
Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary and Secondary Education
Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions
Committee on Oversight and Government Reform
Subcommittee on Government Operations
Subcommittee on Transportation and Public Assets
Joint Economic Committee


=== Caucus memberships ===
Republican Study Committee
Second Amendment Caucus
Congressional Coalition on Adoption
Rare Disease Caucus


== Political positions ==
The Washington Post has described Grothman as "a shambling, strident conservative with a Trumpian tell-it-like-it-is streak who typically votes with the House GOP leadership". According to Axios in October 2020, Grothman had a "Trump Loyalty Index" – measuring both his congressional votes and public reaction to certain statements from President Donald Trump – of 93, higher than any other member of Congress.


=== 4-year-old kindergarten ===
Grothman said Governor Scott Walker should defund Wisconsin's kindergarten program for 4-year-olds, saying that any academic benefits disappear by fourth grade. Politifact rated this "False", writing, "Some studies reached that conclusion. But Grothman is citing one small portion of a much broader debate and declaring the whole matter settled when there is considerable evidence on the other side."


=== Concealed carry ===
Grothman is a longtime supporter of concealed carry legislation, but does not advocate allowing concealed weapons in taverns. He believes concealed carry laws will deter criminal behavior, with permits being given to law-abiding citizens who pass a gun safety course.
Grothman co-introduced 2011 SB 93, which Walker signed into law. This bill made Wisconsin the 49th state to legalize concealed carry.


=== Equal pay ===
Speaking in support of Walker's decision to repeal the Wisconsin Equal Pay Act, Grothman said that the alleged pay differential is explainable: "Once you break it down by married and unmarried, the differential disappears." A study by the American Association of University Women in 2007 found that life choices and family circumstances explain only part of the difference in pay between genders. Grothman rejected that study and added, "You could argue that money is more important for men. I think a guy in their first job, maybe because they expect to be a breadwinner someday, may be a little more money-conscious. To attribute everything to a so-called bias in the workplace is just not true."


=== LGBT rights ===

Grothman opposed a provision in a 2010 sex education law that prohibited teachers from promoting bias based on sexual orientation, saying he did not believe the topic should be discussed at all in public schools. According to the Capitol Times, Grothman's opposition was based on the belief that instructors who lead these talks would have what he called an "agenda" to persuade students to become gay. He postulated that "Part of that agenda which is left unsaid is that some of those who throw it out as an option would like it if more kids became homosexuals."
In April 2014, Grothman said that he was concerned about what God might think of the United States after Secretary of State John Kerry announced plans to send scientists to Uganda in response to a new law against homosexuality; Grothman described Kerry's plans as a way "to say how wonderful the homosexual lifestyle is" and said Republicans, conservatives, and church leaders were not confronting the issue of homosexuality and were "losing the issue": "We had such a great country in the relatively recent past. Now America, supposed to be the light of the world, instead we're the light going in the opposite direction."
In 2015, Grothman cosponsored a resolution to amend the US constitution to ban same-sex marriage. Grothman also cosponsored a resolution disagreeing with the Supreme Court ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, which held that same-sex marriage bans violated the constitution.


=== Kwanzaa ===
In a December 2012 press release, Grothman said that Kwanzaa is not a real holiday: "Of course, almost no black people today care about Kwanzaa—just white left-wingers who try to shove this down black people's throats in an effort to divide Americans."


=== Martin Luther King Jr. Day ===
Grothman has argued that Martin Luther King Jr. Day should not be a state employee holiday, calling it "an insult to all the other taxpayers around the state." He has expressed doubts that "state workers would be 'checking out DVDs or reading books' about King", saying they "would probably just be out shopping or watching television instead."


=== Municipal water chlorination ===
Grothman co-sponsored Senate Bill 19 (2011), which removes the requirement of mandatory chlorination of groundwater in municipal water systems. The bill was supported by the League of Wisconsin Municipalities.


=== Raw milk ===
Grothman is a vocal supporter of decriminalizing raw milk sales.


=== Marriage ===
In February 2012, Grothman introduced Senate Bill 507, which would amend Wisconsin statutes to emphasize non-marital parenthood as a contributing factor to child abuse and neglect. Politifact investigated his claim that kids living with a parent and parent's partner are "20 times" more likely to be sexually abused, and rated it True.
He also sponsored State Bill 202, which would have repealed the Equal Pay Enforcement Act, saying that the "Left and the social welfare establishment want children born out of wedlock because they are far more likely to be dependent on the government."


=== Smoking ===
"Everybody knows you're not supposed to smoke!", he wrote. Grothman also voted against the ban on smoking in bars, restaurants and other small business that became effective in July 2010. After the bill passed, he introduced new legislation to allow lodging establishments, such as hotels, to designate certain rooms as smoking rooms; the bill failed. He also co-sponsored a bill to exempt electronic cigarettes from the smoking ban.


=== Welfare reform ===
In June 2013, Grothman proposed changing Wisconsin's welfare system to require that nondisabled single adults either work 20 hours per week or attend 20 hours of job training per week to continue receiving FoodShare benefits.


=== Israel ===
Grothman voted to support Israel following the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.  He has made little or no comment about the status of the Palestinian people or any right to autonomy or to have their own state.


=== Ukraine ===
In 2024, Grothman voted against the $60 billion military aid package for Ukraine, although much of the money would go to his constituency.


=== Other Information ===
During a debate on the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, Grothman made reference on the House floor to the Black Lives Matter website for once stating "We disrupt the Western-prescribed nuclear family structure Archived 2022-05-13 at the Wayback Machine". He also claimed that President Joe Biden′s inauguration speech was divisive.


== Public image ==
In October 2016, Grothman was featured in the "People Who Somehow Got Elected" segment on HBO's program Last Week Tonight with John Oliver. The segment made reference to Grothman's controversial comments about women and race during his time as an elected official.


== Personal life ==
Grothman is a resident of unincorporated Greenbush, west of Plymouth in Sheboygan County, and practices the Lutheran faith.

Thomas P. Tiffany (born December 30, 1957) is an American businessman and politician serving as the U.S. representative for Wisconsin's 7th congressional district since winning a special election in 2020. A member of the Republican Party, he previously served seven years in the Wisconsin Senate and two years in the State Assembly, representing the northeast region of the state.


== Early life and education ==
Tiffany was born in Wabasha, Minnesota, and grew up on a dairy farm near Elmwood, Pierce County, Wisconsin, with five brothers and two sisters. He graduated from Elmwood High School in 1976 and earned his B.S. in agricultural economics from the University of Wisconsin–River Falls in 1980.
